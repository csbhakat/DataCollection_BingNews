They see a potential market opening up after a New York state lawmaker this month introduced legislation, which would require individual officers to carry liability coverage for lawsuits alleging excessive force, abuse or other misconduct. ""I think we're in a new world,"" said New York-based Mark Turkalo at the insurance brokerage unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc, about the trend. Turkalo said the firm is exploring whether it could develop the coverage. The bill authored by Democratic Senator Alessandra Biaggi follows a number of police reforms in New York and other U.S. states and cities, which were prompted by a wave of protests against police brutality and racial injustice since May. Biaggi's bill would require local governments to pay for the individual policies, but officers would pay any premium increases arising from their misconduct. As premiums rise, ""it would force an officer to either change their behavior or leave the field of law enforcement,"" Biaggi told Reuters. Insurers could build on the handful of policies that already exist for police officers who become embroiled in police work while off duty, said Anne Marie Towle, an executive at broker Hylant Group Inc in Ohio, adding she believes the idea will become more mainstream. She is working with an actuary to analyze potential losses and with Prymus Insurance Co, a private North Carolina insurer specializing in unusual risks, to try and develop a product, she said. Prymus Chief Executive Jeff Harrison confirmed the company is working on police liability coverage. It has to be affordable for police, he said. ""But officers that break the law need to be held accountable."" Currently, most police officers rely on municipalities to cover legal costs and payouts to victims, either from public funds or blanket insurance. Critics say that provides no incentive for officers to check their behavior, often leaving taxpayers on the hook. New York City paid $220 million last year for police department settlements of civil lawsuits, far more than any other of the city's agencies, public data show. [https://tmsnrt.rs/2CZmrT1] The bill faces stiff opposition from powerful police unions who say it would be costly for already-underpaid officers and make recruitment more difficult, but it underscores that the broader concept is starting to gain ground amid the raging debate on police reform. The idea of using liability coverage to sanction police who use excessive force has been championed by some criminal justice experts since 2014, when police fatally shot Black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A similar policy qualified as a Minneapolis ballot measure in 2016, but a court ruling blocked it from being voted on. Colorado last month passed a law that holds police officers personally liable for 5% or $25,000 of damages if their employer determines they did not act in good faith. Policymakers in California and Florida have also expressed interest in the idea, according to Clark Neily, vice president for criminal justice at Washington, D.C., think tank Cato Institute, who has been studying the issue for the past two years. He said he had spoken with a handful of insurers in the last few months about the nuts and bolts of police liability insurance. Some insurers contacted by Reuters privately raised concerns about wading into a political quagmire. They also face a hurdle accessing police disciplinary records, which are confidential in many states, according to legal experts. ""A lot of our clients are asking"" about the policies and carriers are working on coverage, said a senior executive at a U.S. insurance broker who was not authorized to speak publicly. Neily's discussions with insurers have focused on how much to charge and where to cap payouts. Based on those discussions, he said he believes $500,000 or $1 million would cover most claims and that cities could use broader policies to cover amounts beyond that. ""The real challenge is assessing the exposure and pricing policies accordingly,"" said Neily. ""Some insurance companies feel that is too challenging. Others feel like this is absolutely something they will be able to work with."""

Chauvin and his wife, Kellie May Chauvin, who filed for divorce after Floyd's death, were each charged in Washington County with nine felony counts of filing false tax returns or failing to file tax returns. Chauvin and his wife are accused of underreporting their joint income in state tax returns by $464,433 from 2014 through 2019. Chauvin earned more than $95,000 for his work as an off-duty security guard that was not reported. ""When you fail to fulfill the basic obligation to file and pay taxes, you are taking money from the pockets of citizens of Minnesota. Our office has and will continue to file these charges when presented. Whether you are a prosecutor or police officer, or you are doctor or a realtor, no one is above the law,"" Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said in a statement. Chauvin is one of four former Minneapolis police officers who were fired and later charged in connection to the death of Floyd. Floyd, a Black man, was held to the ground as Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd repeatedly told the officers he could not breathe. Autopsy reports ruled his death a homicide, and Chauvin faces second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The investigation into Chauvin and his wife's taxes began in June after the Minnesota Department of Revenue received information about suspicious filings. According to a criminal complaint, the Chauvins did not report all of their income when filing their state taxes in 2014 and 2015. From 2016 through 2018, they did not file state taxes. The Chauvins this year did file tax returns for 2016 through 2019, but they underreported their income in those years, too, the complaint says. The Chauvins owe $37,868 to the state. Chauvin worked off-duty security at a variety of locations in addition to his work as a Minneapolis police officer. He was required to pay taxes on the income he earned while off-duty. The criminal complaint says Chauvin worked almost every weekend at El Nuevo Rodeo restaurant from from January 2014 through December 2019. He earned roughly $220 a night, and a total of $95,920 was allegedly not reported on state taxes. His wife, a real estate agent and photographer, is accused of not reporting $66,472.75 from 340 checks received at her photography business in 2014 and 2015. The Chauvins also allegedly did not pay proper taxes on the sale of a rental home in 2017 and the purchase of a $100,000 BMW in 2018, prosecutors said. The Associated Press reported that Chauvin's attorney in the murder case declined to comment while his wife's attorney in the divorce did not respond to a request for comment. Neither had attorney listed in the tax case."

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Tampa Bay Rays called for the arrest of the Louisville police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in a tweet on Friday, hours before their opening day game against the Toronto Blue Jays. The tweet from the Rays official Twitter account early Friday morning read: “Today is Opening Day, which means it's a great day to arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor.” The message was followed by a secondary tweet announcing a $100,000 donation to local organizations fighting against systemic racism. “Systemic racism is real. Let’s unite for positive change,” another tweet read. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot eight times as officers burst into her home on Springfield Drive, firing over 20 rounds, as they were conducting no-knock warrant related to a narcotics investigation on March 13. None of the officers involved in the shooting have been arrested or charged. The Kentucky Attorney General’s Office is still investigating. The Rays statement comes a day after MLB players held a black ribbon and kneeled together in a moment honoring the Black Lives Matter movement on Opening Day. San Francisco Giants relief pitcher Sam Coonrod was the only player in both games not to take a knee, arguing that because of his faith “I can’t kneel before anything besides God.” Most members of the San Francisco Giants kneel during a moment of silence prior to an opening day baseball game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Thursday, July 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) “I just can’t get on board with a couple things I’ve read about Black Lives Matter, how they lean towards Marxism,” Coonrod continued. “And … they said some negative things about the nuclear family. I just can’t get on board with that.” Coonrod didn't elaborate on what he was referring to, but he did tell reporters that he meant no ""ill will"" by his gesture.

Derek Chauvin and his estranged wife, Kellie May Chauvin, were charged on Wednesday by Washington County prosecutors with failing to file their taxes since 2016 and filing fraudulent returns since 2014. The couple, who have two homes in Oakdale, Minnesota, and one in Windermere, Florida, owe $37,868 in taxes and penalties, according to the criminal complaint. Derek Chauvin is currently in custody at the Minnesota Correctional Facility at Oak Park Heights on $1.25 million bond following his arrest for the May 25 death of Floyd. He has entered a not guilty plea to the murder charges. His attorney for the Floyd case, Eric Nelson, declined to comment to ABC News on Thursday about the tax evasion charges or confirm whether he would represent the couple in that case. Chauvin, a 19-year law enforcement veteran, was seen on cellphone video pressing his knee into Floyd's neck as Floyd lay on the ground struggling to breathe and calling for his mother. Kellie May Chauvin filed for divorce after Derek Chauvin and three other Minneapolis officers were arrested on felony murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd's death. The Chauvins are now facing six counts each of filing false or fraudulent returns and three counts each of failure to file returns, according to court documents. If convicted, they face up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines. ""When you fail to fulfill the basic obligation to file and pay taxes, you are taking money from the pockets of citizens of Minnesota,"" Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said in a statement. ""Our office has and will continue to file these charges when presented. Whether you are a prosecutor or police officer, or you are a doctor or a realtor, no one is above the law."" According to the complaint, the Minnesota Department of Revenue's investigation into the Chauvins started on June 12 following multiple correspondences sent in 2019 by the department regarding their missing 2016 individual income tax return. In addition to Derek Chauvin's earnings from the Minneapolis Police Department, he worked since 2014 as an off-duty security guard at four businesses, the complaint said. ""D. Chauvin earned approximately $95,920.00 between January 2014 and December 2019 from El Nuevo Rodeo that the Chauvins did not report as income,"" according to the complaint. The 44-year-old also worked as a licensed Realtor for RE/MAX Results in 2017, earning $9,477.50 that was not reported, the complaint said. Kellie May Chauvin, 45, has worked as a licensed Realtor for RE/MAX Results in Eden Prairie since 2016 but did not  report that income, according to the complaint. She also operates a photography business under the name ""KC Images,"" for which she allegedly did not report her income in 2014 and 2015, according to the complaint. She told investigators that she did not file income tax returns because ""it got away from her,"" according to the criminal complaint. Her father was their accountant for at least two tax seasons, the complaint said. The couple allegedly purchased a 2018 BMW X5 in January 2018 for more than $100,000 and registered it under their address in Florida, where they allegedly avoided paying more than $5,000 in sales tax. Kellie May Chauvin allegedly told investigators last month that they changed their residency to Florida ""because it was cheaper to register a car,"" according to the criminal complaint. A court date has not yet been set for the Chauvins' arraignment, prosecutors confirmed to ABC News on Thursday."

officer arrested,https://www.foxnews.com/us/philly-da-warns-feds-arrested-storm-protests,Philly DA warns federal officers could be arrested if they storm Pennsylvania protests,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The district attorney in Philadelphia is warning federal officers that they could face arrest if they bring their tactics of ""abuse of power"" to his city. District Attorney Larry Krasner accused President Trump of ""acting like an authoritarian dictator,"" he said on an appearance on MSNBC's ""The ReidOut"" Thursday and cautioned him not to send federal agents to his city. The stern words come as agents from the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, Federal Protective Service, and U.S. Marshals Service were deployed to Portland, Ore. and Washington, D.C., to quell pockets of violence stemming from otherwise peaceful demonstrations denouncing police brutality and racial inequality. Trump said the agents are there with the purpose of protecting federal buildings and property from destruction, as protesters continue to light fires and vandalize many edifices in different cities. However, reports of excessive force by federal officers on protesters, and agents who failed to properly identify themselves during demonstrations or give adequate reasoning for sweeping arrests, have pushed the Justice Department to open an investigation into the officers' conduct. Krasner says the extra strongarming isn't needed in Philadelphia. ""While the City of Philadelphia has not received any formal notification that federal agents will be sent here, we would use all available means to resist such an abuse of power,"" the district attorney said in a tweet on Monday. Philadelphia police are facing backlash themselves, and one member of the city's SWAT team will be dismissed Friday after video surfaced of officers spraying peaceful demonstrators with pepper spray while the protesters were trapped on Interstate 676 by officers on either side of the highway. Protesters marching against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd are detained by police in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania June 1, 2020. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw issued a moratorium on the use of tear gas in most situations, including to disperse crowds of nonviolent people. The commissioner's office did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on how the city would theoretically deal with arresting or detaining federal officers if they used excessive force during a protest.

When federal officers deployed tear gas, some protesters, in part affiliated with ""PDX Dad Pod,"" used leaf blowers to blow back the gas. A man who attended Monday’s Portland protest as part of the PDX Dad Pod, was arrested by federal officers early Tuesday morning. He said officers took him to the ground after they tried to take away his leaf blower. Zack Duffly, a 44-year-old Portland attorney, attended the protests for the first time Monday. He said he went to express his opposition of police treatment of Black people and of federal officers’ treatment of protesters in downtown Portland. He arrived before 9 p.m. and met up with the group of dads, who organized to protest and support the Wall of Moms. Many Dads wore orange, hard hats and some brought leaf blowers which can be used to disperse tear gas. They marched and listened to speakers. Duffly sent text updates to his wife throughout the night. “Just kind of marching around,” he texted around 11:30. “Very mellow.” His wife sent a text a bit later telling him to let her know if there is an emergency. “And that was it for the next 14 hours,” Duffly said. Around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, officers used tear gas on the crowd. Duffly said he didn’t hear any warning, but started backing up and leaving amid flashbangs. There was an officer nearby who was telling people to get out of the street. Duffly said he didn’t feel threatened by the officer at that time. One of the agents in camo, holding a baton, came from Duffly’s side and charged him, he said. Duffly believes he was targeted because he brought a leaf blower. Duffly said the agent tried to grab his leaf blower, which was strapped to his body. Since he didn’t have time to unstrap, he said he was taken to the ground and his glasses were broken as the two officers arrested him. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Duffly’s arrest. After being arrested, he said an officer led him into the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse. He said he could still feel his skin burning from the tear gas, and was unable to see well without his glasses. As he waited to go into the holding area, he said he saw Jennifer Kristiansen, a mom who was arrested at the protest, and they spoke for a moment. He said he complimented Kristiansen on her rainbow skirt. As he was processed by officers, he said he didn’t have time to understand what had just happened and what was going on at each particular moment. He said the night entailed a lot of waiting with no information. He said when he asked various questions, like when he could have a phone call, he was told that a different agency was in charge of that. “There was a lot of inter-agency buck-passing,” he said. “Also, legitimate logistical hiccups.” Duffly said the confusion seemed partly because of coronavirus rules and restrictions, but also because of out-of-town agents being unfamiliar with processes and the buildings. He said he was read his Miranda rights before officers tried to conduct an interview with him. Duffly said he chose to not answer questions. He tried to calm down and get comfortable on the metal bench in the holding cell, but got very little sleep that night. He was transported around 7 a.m. Tuesday to the Justice Center. He said while there, he was placed with other detainees who didn’t have masks on in a very confined space. He said he had earlier been sent to a nurse, who made sure he wasn’t hurt and asked about coronavirus symptoms. He was told he had an arraignment around 11 a.m., and waited for that to come. But at that point, he said, he still didn’t know what he was being charged with. After asking continually throughout the whole time, he finally got to call his wife. She’d already guessed he had been arrested after waking up around 3 a.m. and seeing he wasn’t yet home. She called a hotline to figure out what happened. His arraignment happened around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. He was charged with federal disorderly conduct. He has a trial date set for the misdemeanor charge. He also has a curfew and cannot be within five blocks of the courthouse. In the days following, he said he can still feel and smell the tear gas. But the “greatest amount of stress right now,” he said, is that he was doxed, meaning his personal information, including home address, was posted on Twitter. He has received a threat since that happened and has installed security cameras at his home. He said his experience was “terrifying” but believes that was the intent. “I think federal agents are here to terrorize the city and to chill our free speech and our rights to assembly,” he said. --Alex Hardgrave | ahardgrave@oregonian.com | @a_hardgrave Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

Derek Chauvin and his wife, Kellie Chauvin, were each charged by summons in Washington County District Court with nine counts of felony tax evasion. The complaint, filed by the Washington County attorney, accuses the couple of underreporting and underpaying Minnesota taxes dating back to 2014. The complaint also accuses the couple, who filed taxes jointly, of not filing state returns for the tax years 2016 to 2019. The complaint accuses the couple of underreporting more than $464,000 in joint income between 2014 and 2019 and says they owe the state nearly $38,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest. Chauvin, 46, was arrested May 29 and charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s killing during a Memorial Day encounter with police in South Minneapolis. Chauvin was filmed with his knee on Floyd’s neck for roughly eight minutes, according to police body camera video, as Floyd complained he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving. Chauvin is being held on a minimum $1 million bond at a state prison. Kellie Chauvin, a real estate agent, filed for divorce on May 29. Her attorney did not respond to a request for comment. The charges came amid intense scrutiny of Chauvin’s personal and professional life and questions about his residency. Public records show Chauvin and his wife owned two homes — one in Oakdale, Minn., a Twin Cities suburb, and another in Windermere, Fla., near Orlando, which was purchased in 2011. Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police who was fired the day after Floyd’s death, worked more than 200 days a year as a full-time police officer between 2014 and 2019, according to court records filed Wednesday. He had worked 100 days in 2020 until he was fired. Yet Chauvin, who also briefly worked as a Minneapolis-area real estate agent, identified himself as a resident of Florida on his Minnesota real estate license. Public records show he also voted in the 2016 and 2018 general election in Florida. Under state law, someone is considered a resident of Minnesota if they spend at least 183 days in the state during the year and the person or their spouse rents or owns a home “that is suitable for year-round use.” Investigators say Chauvin’s income and time spent in the state more than qualified him to be a legal resident of Minnesota. The complaint filed Wednesday says Chauvin and his wife had drawn scrutiny from the Minnesota Department of Revenue long before Floyd’s killing because of their failure to pay taxes. It says letters were sent to the couple beginning in 2019 seeking information on their “missing” returns and warning of criminal charges if they did not file taxes, but the couple did not respond. State tax investigators launched a probe into the couple’s finances on June 12, after Chauvin’s arrest. The court filing identifies several sources of income for the couple over the years, including Chauvin’s police salary. The complaint says Chauvin earned between $52,476 and $72,029 per year as a Minneapolis police officer between 2014 and 2019. The filing also documents several off-duty security jobs, including at El Nuevo Rodeo, a club near the police precinct where Chauvin was based and where Floyd occasionally worked. An unidentified witness quoted in the complaint says Chauvin worked “nearly every weekend” at the club between January 2014 and December 2019, earning roughly $220 a night. The complaint also says Chauvin worked four shifts per month at a nearby club, EME Antro Bar, starting in June 2019 and was paid $250 a night in cash. Prosecutors say Chauvin did not report or pay taxes on that income — which investigators estimated to be at least $95,000 from El Nuevo Rodeo alone. “When you fail to fulfill the basic obligation to file and pay taxes, you are taking money from the pockets of citizens of Minnesota,” Washington County Attorney Pete Orput, who filed the charges, said in a statement. “Whether you are a prosecutor or a police officer, or you are a doctor or a realtor, no one is above the law.” According to court records, investigators were able to document Chauvin’s off-duty work schedule and other financial information after executing a June 25 search warrant at his former home in Oakdale, which was recently put up for sale. The complaint says the home “was mostly empty,” but investigators discovered “a box of financial and tax documents, work schedules and other correspondence” that had been left behind in the garage. The box contained Chauvin’s “handwritten work schedules” documenting his shifts at El Nuevo Rodeo between January 2014 and July 2016. The complaint also says investigators searched the home of Chauvin’s father, Robert, an accountant who prepared the couple’s 2014 and 2015 tax returns that he said were based on information the couple provided him. Robert Chauvin told investigators he had filed an extension on the couple’s 2016 tax returns but was never provided the information to complete them. In a statement issued May 29, the same day her husband was arrested and charged in Floyd’s killing, Kellie Chauvin announced she was filing for divorce. Court documents show she is asking for all of the couple’s property, including ownership of their two homes. Derek Chauvin has not responded to her divorce filing, and county records show he has not yet retained an attorney in the divorce. Court filings show the couple have been in touch. The complaint says Kellie Chauvin, who is accused of underreporting more than $66,000 in freelance income, called her husband at the state prison in Oak Park Heights on June 26 — one day after she and an accountant met with tax investigators who asked about the couple’s finances. The filing said Kellie Chauvin admitted to investigators that the couple’s Minnesota home was “their primary residence.” She told investigators she usually spent December and January at their home in Florida and that her husband wasn’t always there because of his work schedule. She told investigators she hadn’t filed taxes because “it got away from her.” The next day, Kellie Chauvin called her husband in prison, where all inmate calls are recorded, to warn him that people were looking into their taxes. Derek Chauvin suggested calling their regular accountant, according to the complaint. “Yeah, well, we don’t want to get your dad involved because he will just be mad at me, I mean us, for not doing them for years,” Kellie Chauvin replied, according to court records.

Chauvin and his wife, Kellie May Chauvin, who filed for divorce after Floyd's death, were each charged in Washington County with nine felony counts of filing false tax returns or failing to file tax returns. Chauvin and his wife are accused of underreporting their joint income in state tax returns by $464,433 from 2014 through 2019. Chauvin earned more than $95,000 for his work as an off-duty security guard that was not reported. ""When you fail to fulfill the basic obligation to file and pay taxes, you are taking money from the pockets of citizens of Minnesota. Our office has and will continue to file these charges when presented. Whether you are a prosecutor or police officer, or you are doctor or a realtor, no one is above the law,"" Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said in a statement. Chauvin is one of four former Minneapolis police officers who were fired and later charged in connection to the death of Floyd. Floyd, a Black man, was held to the ground as Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd repeatedly told the officers he could not breathe. Autopsy reports ruled his death a homicide, and Chauvin faces second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The investigation into Chauvin and his wife's taxes began in June after the Minnesota Department of Revenue received information about suspicious filings. According to a criminal complaint, the Chauvins did not report all of their income when filing their state taxes in 2014 and 2015. From 2016 through 2018, they did not file state taxes. The Chauvins this year did file tax returns for 2016 through 2019, but they underreported their income in those years, too, the complaint says. The Chauvins owe $37,868 to the state. Chauvin worked off-duty security at a variety of locations in addition to his work as a Minneapolis police officer. He was required to pay taxes on the income he earned while off-duty. The criminal complaint says Chauvin worked almost every weekend at El Nuevo Rodeo restaurant from from January 2014 through December 2019. He earned roughly $220 a night, and a total of $95,920 was allegedly not reported on state taxes. His wife, a real estate agent and photographer, is accused of not reporting $66,472.75 from 340 checks received at her photography business in 2014 and 2015. The Chauvins also allegedly did not pay proper taxes on the sale of a rental home in 2017 and the purchase of a $100,000 BMW in 2018, prosecutors said. The Associated Press reported that Chauvin's attorney in the murder case declined to comment while his wife's attorney in the divorce did not respond to a request for comment. Neither had attorney listed in the tax case."

Derek Chauvin and his estranged wife, Kellie May Chauvin, were charged on Wednesday by Washington County prosecutors with failing to file their taxes since 2016 and filing fraudulent returns since 2014. The couple, who have two homes in Oakdale, Minnesota, and one in Windermere, Florida, owe $37,868 in taxes and penalties, according to the criminal complaint. Derek Chauvin is currently in custody at the Minnesota Correctional Facility at Oak Park Heights on $1.25 million bond following his arrest for the May 25 death of Floyd. He has entered a not guilty plea to the murder charges. His attorney for the Floyd case, Eric Nelson, declined to comment to ABC News on Thursday about the tax evasion charges or confirm whether he would represent the couple in that case. Chauvin, a 19-year law enforcement veteran, was seen on cellphone video pressing his knee into Floyd's neck as Floyd lay on the ground struggling to breathe and calling for his mother. Kellie May Chauvin filed for divorce after Derek Chauvin and three other Minneapolis officers were arrested on felony murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd's death. The Chauvins are now facing six counts each of filing false or fraudulent returns and three counts each of failure to file returns, according to court documents. If convicted, they face up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines.

""Our office has and will continue to file these charges when presented. Whether you are a prosecutor or police officer, or you are a doctor or a realtor, no one is above the law."" According to the complaint, the Minnesota Department of Revenue's investigation into the Chauvins started on June 12 following multiple correspondences sent in 2019 by the department regarding their missing 2016 individual income tax return. In addition to Derek Chauvin's earnings from the Minneapolis Police Department, he worked since 2014 as an off-duty security guard at four businesses, the complaint said. ""D. Chauvin earned approximately $95,920.00 between January 2014 and December 2019 from El Nuevo Rodeo that the Chauvins did not report as income,"" according to the complaint. The 44-year-old also worked as a licensed Realtor for RE/MAX Results in 2017, earning $9,477.50 that was not reported, the complaint said. Kellie May Chauvin, 45, has worked as a licensed Realtor for RE/MAX Results in Eden Prairie since 2016 but did not  report that income, according to the complaint. She also operates a photography business under the name ""KC Images,"" for which she allegedly did not report her income in 2014 and 2015, according to the complaint. She told investigators that she did not file income tax returns because ""it got away from her,"" according to the criminal complaint. Her father was their accountant for at least two tax seasons, the complaint said. The couple allegedly purchased a 2018 BMW X5 in January 2018 for more than $100,000 and registered it under their address in Florida, where they allegedly avoided paying more than $5,000 in sales tax. Kellie May Chauvin allegedly told investigators last month that they changed their residency to Florida ""because it was cheaper to register a car,"" according to the criminal complaint. A court date has not yet been set for the Chauvins' arraignment, prosecutors confirmed to ABC News on Thursday."

The announcement ended a yearslong drama that included the issuance of an international arrest warrant for the heir to one of the country’s most storied companies and largest fortunes and a public outcry over the seemingly separate system of justice for the country’s richest people. Just before dawn on a dark Bangkok street on a September night in 2012, a speeding Ferrari struck and killed a motorcycle police officer. The driver fled the scene, but a trail of leaking engine fluid led police to his door — and the damaged Ferrari — a short distance away. Police arrested the driver, Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, the grandson of the inventor of the Red Bull energy drink and heir to one of Thailand’s greatest fortunes. Police said at the time that he had been intoxicated and admitted that his car hit the officer, Wichean Glanprasert. But in a case often cited as an example of the special treatment received by Thailand’s elite, Vorayuth was never brought to justice. He fled the country and has been living in luxury for years. On Friday, police said they were dropping the last charge in the case, reckless driving resulting in someone’s death, and were withdrawing Thai and Interpol warrants for his arrest. A police spokesman, Col. Krisana Pattanajaroen, said police had followed all proper procedures in the case. “It’s quite normal,” he said. “We strictly followed the protocol here.” The process of withdrawing the arrest warrants will be completed soon, and Vorayuth, 37, who goes by the nickname “Boss,” will be able to return to Thailand if he wishes. “After that, he’ll be free,” Krisana said. During the investigation, Vorayuth repeatedly ignored police summonses. He fled the country in 2017, shortly before the first arrest warrant was issued. Three charges — speeding, hit-and-run driving and reckless driving causing damage to another person — were dropped earlier because the statute of limitations had expired. Soon after the crash, Vorayuth’s family paid the police officer’s family nearly $100,000 in compensation, and Vorayuth resumed his jet-set lifestyle, traveling around the world on private Red Bull jets, keeping a Porsche in London and staying in luxury hotels. Prosecutors decided to close the case last month, but news of the decision did not surface until this week. In a June 18 letter to Vorayuth, a police deputy director of investigations, Lt. Col. Thanawut Sanguansuk, informed him of the decision. “This case is therefore terminated in accordance with the legal process,” the letter said. The outcome was what the family of Wichean, the motorcycle officer, expected long ago. Vorayuth “is powerful, has many connections and a lot of money,” the officer’s older brother, Pornanand Glanprasert, said in a 2013 interview. “If you are common people like us, I think the case is already finished,” he said. “He is going to try very hard not to be charged — or at the very least to get a suspended sentence or no punishment at all.” c.2020 The New York Times Company"
officer charged,https://www.foxnews.com/us/philly-da-warns-feds-arrested-storm-protests,Philly DA warns federal officers could be arrested if they storm Pennsylvania protests,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The district attorney in Philadelphia is warning federal officers that they could face arrest if they bring their tactics of ""abuse of power"" to his city. District Attorney Larry Krasner accused President Trump of ""acting like an authoritarian dictator,"" he said on an appearance on MSNBC's ""The ReidOut"" Thursday and cautioned him not to send federal agents to his city. The stern words come as agents from the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, Federal Protective Service, and U.S. Marshals Service were deployed to Portland, Ore. and Washington, D.C., to quell pockets of violence stemming from otherwise peaceful demonstrations denouncing police brutality and racial inequality. Trump said the agents are there with the purpose of protecting federal buildings and property from destruction, as protesters continue to light fires and vandalize many edifices in different cities. However, reports of excessive force by federal officers on protesters, and agents who failed to properly identify themselves during demonstrations or give adequate reasoning for sweeping arrests, have pushed the Justice Department to open an investigation into the officers' conduct. Krasner says the extra strongarming isn't needed in Philadelphia. ""While the City of Philadelphia has not received any formal notification that federal agents will be sent here, we would use all available means to resist such an abuse of power,"" the district attorney said in a tweet on Monday. Philadelphia police are facing backlash themselves, and one member of the city's SWAT team will be dismissed Friday after video surfaced of officers spraying peaceful demonstrators with pepper spray while the protesters were trapped on Interstate 676 by officers on either side of the highway. Protesters marching against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd are detained by police in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania June 1, 2020. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw issued a moratorium on the use of tear gas in most situations, including to disperse crowds of nonviolent people. The commissioner's office did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on how the city would theoretically deal with arresting or detaining federal officers if they used excessive force during a protest.

Theoddeus Gray, 29, was shot by police Nov. 4, 2018, near Lakeland Manor Banquet Hall on Harper Avenue. A police K-9 named Axe also was fatally shot. The office agreed to  a request by Gray's parents for an independent review of the evidence to determine whether any officer involved may be subject to criminal proceedings for their action, according to the 48-page report. Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning. Officers went to the banquet hall after receiving a frantic 911 call about a man with a gun. Gray was there to attend his girlfriend’s baby shower. Police said Gray fired on them while fleeing and was found with a gun. The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office investigated the shooting in 2018 and determined there was no evidence to substantiate any wrongdoing by the St. Clair Shores officers. The sheriff's office declined to submit a warrant request. Attorney General Dana Nessel's office said in the release that the report was completed in April and continued through internal review processes in the following weeks. “This report is part of my office’s commitment to transparency and accountability,” Nessel said. “We never want the response of law enforcement to escalate into lethal use of force. However, when that does occur, our job is to obtain and review all evidence before deciding whether any criminal wrongdoing took place according to existing law. In this particular case, the evidence suggests that the actions of the St. Clair Shores police officers do not warrant criminal charges."" The report indicates Gray was causing a disturbance by brandishing a handgun at the banquet hall, frightening others, according to the release from Nessel's office. More: Family of man killed by St. Clair Shores police files $10M lawsuit When police arrived, it states, Gray ignored their requests to talk and their commands to stop. As he fled, Gray fired a round at the officers, who then returned fire, ultimately resulting in Gray’s death. ""I'm glad they came to the same conclusions as us. Our investigators put a lot of time and effort reviewing this case,"" Sheriff Anthony Wickersham said. message seeking comment was left late Friday afternoon for St. Clair Shores Police Chief Todd Woodcox. Oliver Gantt, spokesman for Gray's family, said the case was prematurely closed by Wickersham and not forwarded to the prosecutor's office. He said the investigator assigned by the Attorney General's Office didn't interview witnesses or take close inspection of video, which he claims was doctored by the sheriff's office. ""Even though there is pending litigation, we will pursue the Department of Justice asking them to investigate the case,"" Gantt said, adding he wants to talk with Nessel personally ""because I believe she will take a closer look at this case and render a different conclusion."" Gray's mother, Tracy Jenkins, said through Gantt that she and her husband were to have a meeting with the Attorney General's Office earlier this year. The coronavirus hit and her husband died of COVID-19 in April. She said the office later said it did a full investigation and interviewed family witnesses, but she said she later learned that the office didn't call any of the witnesses. In February 2019, Gray's family filed a $10-million lawsuit against the city and five officers in U.S. District Court in Detroit. An interim status conference is set for Aug. 13 with a jury trial date set for June 15, 2021, according to court records. The lawsuit alleges that Gray was unarmed and had already surrendered to police when he was killed outside the banquet hall. A rally and march for Gray was held June 27 in St. Clair Shores. Authorities originally said that officers opened fire on Gray after he shot the K-9. Axe was shot and fatally wounded during the foot chase.

The lawsuit stated one of the officers did. pertinent to this review."" Gray was shot five or six times, per the report from Nessel's office. Wickersham had said in 2018 that the officers fired a total of 48 shots. No officers were hit. Wickersham also had said that Gray had a FN57 5.7mm pistol that is believed to have jammed after he fired the first shot. He said the gun was found under Gray. More: St. Clair Shores march and rally for Theo Gray The report from Nessel's office indicates the escalation of conflict began as a result of a conflict between Gray and a business associate. Five days earlier, Gray was arrested in North Dakota for trafficking prescription pills. Gray and the associate recently had a falling out over money that Gray owed the associate. The associate learned Gray would be at the banquet hall and arrived with three other people and an AK-47, which was found at the rear of the building, according to the report. On Thursday, Nessel's office said it would review another 2018 fatal shooting by police officers in Shelby Township. Kanwarbir Malhi, 25, was shot after getting out of a vehicle in the parking lot of an apartment complex where he lived along Spring Lane. Authorities said he refused to comply with orders and they thought he may have had a weapon. They later determined he was unarmed. The sheriff's office investigated Malhi's death in November 2018. The prosecutor's office reviewed the case, and no charges were authorized against the officers involved, the sheriff's office announced in a release in February 2019.

When federal officers deployed tear gas, some protesters, in part affiliated with ""PDX Dad Pod,"" used leaf blowers to blow back the gas. A man who attended Monday’s Portland protest as part of the PDX Dad Pod, was arrested by federal officers early Tuesday morning. He said officers took him to the ground after they tried to take away his leaf blower. Zack Duffly, a 44-year-old Portland attorney, attended the protests for the first time Monday. He said he went to express his opposition of police treatment of Black people and of federal officers’ treatment of protesters in downtown Portland. He arrived before 9 p.m. and met up with the group of dads, who organized to protest and support the Wall of Moms. Many Dads wore orange, hard hats and some brought leaf blowers which can be used to disperse tear gas. They marched and listened to speakers. Duffly sent text updates to his wife throughout the night. “Just kind of marching around,” he texted around 11:30. “Very mellow.” His wife sent a text a bit later telling him to let her know if there is an emergency. “And that was it for the next 14 hours,” Duffly said. Around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, officers used tear gas on the crowd. Duffly said he didn’t hear any warning, but started backing up and leaving amid flashbangs. There was an officer nearby who was telling people to get out of the street. Duffly said he didn’t feel threatened by the officer at that time. One of the agents in camo, holding a baton, came from Duffly’s side and charged him, he said. Duffly believes he was targeted because he brought a leaf blower. Duffly said the agent tried to grab his leaf blower, which was strapped to his body. Since he didn’t have time to unstrap, he said he was taken to the ground and his glasses were broken as the two officers arrested him. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Duffly’s arrest. After being arrested, he said an officer led him into the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse. He said he could still feel his skin burning from the tear gas, and was unable to see well without his glasses. As he waited to go into the holding area, he said he saw Jennifer Kristiansen, a mom who was arrested at the protest, and they spoke for a moment. He said he complimented Kristiansen on her rainbow skirt. As he was processed by officers, he said he didn’t have time to understand what had just happened and what was going on at each particular moment. He said the night entailed a lot of waiting with no information. He said when he asked various questions, like when he could have a phone call, he was told that a different agency was in charge of that. “There was a lot of inter-agency buck-passing,” he said. “Also, legitimate logistical hiccups.” Duffly said the confusion seemed partly because of coronavirus rules and restrictions, but also because of out-of-town agents being unfamiliar with processes and the buildings. He said he was read his Miranda rights before officers tried to conduct an interview with him. Duffly said he chose to not answer questions. He tried to calm down and get comfortable on the metal bench in the holding cell, but got very little sleep that night. He was transported around 7 a.m. Tuesday to the Justice Center. He said while there, he was placed with other detainees who didn’t have masks on in a very confined space. He said he had earlier been sent to a nurse, who made sure he wasn’t hurt and asked about coronavirus symptoms. He was told he had an arraignment around 11 a.m., and waited for that to come. But at that point, he said, he still didn’t know what he was being charged with. After asking continually throughout the whole time, he finally got to call his wife. She’d already guessed he had been arrested after waking up around 3 a.m. and seeing he wasn’t yet home. She called a hotline to figure out what happened. His arraignment happened around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. He was charged with federal disorderly conduct. He has a trial date set for the misdemeanor charge. He also has a curfew and cannot be within five blocks of the courthouse. In the days following, he said he can still feel and smell the tear gas. But the “greatest amount of stress right now,” he said, is that he was doxed, meaning his personal information, including home address, was posted on Twitter. He has received a threat since that happened and has installed security cameras at his home. He said his experience was “terrifying” but believes that was the intent. “I think federal agents are here to terrorize the city and to chill our free speech and our rights to assembly,” he said. --Alex Hardgrave | ahardgrave@oregonian.com | @a_hardgrave Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

Officers Matthew G. Brummett and Charles Prichard are charged with “knowingly causing physical injury” to Breona, or “Briya,” Hill as she was handcuffed, according to the Jackson County Prosecutor’s Office. A grand jury first indicted the officers in May on misdemeanor charges of fourth degree assault. Two new witnesses came forward following the May indictment. The grand jury, after receiving additional testimony, indicted the officers with felonies of third degree assault for “knowingly causing physical injury to the victim by slamming her face against the concrete sidewalk, kneeing her in the face, torso and ribs and forcing her arms over her head while cuffed,” according to the prosecutor’s office. According to an affidavit signed on Friday by foreperson of the grand jury, one witness, the lead defensive tactics instructor at the Regional Police Academy during the summer of 2019, said they looked at media reports and a video of the arrest. That witness said there were “several issues with force used during the arrest,” according to the prosecutor’s office, conclusions supported by the instructor’s commanders. Those commanders raised other issues with the arrest. The two officers went through retraining. A second witness, a former defensive tactics instructor who also reviewed media reports, reached out to KCPD about issues with the force used during the arrest. The grand jury was also given evidence about Hill’s injuries due to the force used during the arrest. She was taken to the police department’s east patrol station and was issued citations for trespassing, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and possession of drug paraphernalia. Later, an ambulance was called for her. Hill had injuries to her face and complained of pain in multiple parts of her body, according to the affidavit. Photos taken of her at the hospital showed a cut above her eye, multiple abrasions on her face and dried blood. In a statement released later Friday night, Brad Lemon, president of the Kansas City Fraternal Order of Police, said the union continues to stand by the officers. Lemon said he doesn’t believe any new evidence has appeared since the case went to the grand jury in May. “This is another example of political prosecution and abuse of power by the Jackson County Prosecutor who is attempting to resurrect a failing career on the backs of the good men and woman of the KCPD,” Lemon said in the statement. In a separate incident, Hill was shot and killed near a home in the 4300 block of Hardesty Avenue on Oct. 14, 2019. ©2020 The Kansas City Star (Kansas City, Mo.)

officer fired,https://www.startribune.com/fired-minneapolis-officer-derek-chauvin-wife-charged-with-tax-crimes/571864051/,"Fired Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, wife charged with tax crimes","The fired Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd was charged along with his wife Wednesday with felony tax crimes dating back to 2014 that allege failure to claim more than $460,000 in income — at least $96,000 of that in his off-duty security work. Derek Chauvin and Kellie Chauvin, of Oakdale, were each charged by summons in Washington County District Court with nine felony counts of aiding and abetting false or fraudulent tax returns or failing to file returns. From 2014 to 2019, the Chauvins underreported $464,433 in joint income and owed a total of $21,853 in taxes, according to the charges. With interest and late filing and fraud penalties, they owe $37,868, the complaints said. Derek Chauvin, 46, remains jailed on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in connection with the death of Floyd while in police custody on May 25. Three other ex-officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin. Kellie Chauvin, 45, who has filed for divorce since her husband was charged, was not available for comment. County Attorney Pete Orput said the investigation of the two “was in the works well before” Derek Chauvin was charged with Floyd’s death in late May. Orput said state Department of Revenue officials contacted his office in June with what they found, and “they were sending [Chauvin] letters last year” about no returns being filed, “and they got no response.” Then, when Derek Chauvin came under worldwide attention for his role in Floyd’s killing, revenue officials “read the guy’s name and realize this is their guy,” Orput said. The county attorney called the Chauvins’ tax troubles “run of the mill, but it just happens to be the [police officer] sitting in Oak Park [Heights prison]. … The guy owes us money, and I want to collect. I don’t care about his other problems.” The filing includes a litany of allegations. Among them, prosecutors say the Chauvins bought a new BMW X5 in January 2018 for $100,230 from a Minnetonka dealership and registered the SUV in Florida — they own a condo in Windermere, outside Orlando — and paid $4,664 in taxes in that state. However, the vehicle was serviced 11 times in Minnetonka and never in Florida, investigators say they found. Kellie Chauvin told investigators they opted for Florida because it was less expensive. The taxes due on the SUV had it been registered in Minnesota were $5,053. Court records do not list an attorney for either of the Chauvins. Derek Chauvin’s criminal attorney, Eric Nelson, said he knows nothing about the tax allegations. The counts and their dates are identical for the Chauvins. There are six involving aiding and abetting allegations of false or fraudulent returns starting with the 2014 tax year. The others allege not filing taxes for 2016, 2017 and 2018. The charges document various sources of income for the couple. The complaints said that between 2014 and 2019, Derek Chauvin made between $52,000 and $72,000 annually as a police officer. He also worked off-duty security nearly every weekend in that time at El Nuevo Rodeo dance club, Cub Foods, Midtown Global Market and EME Antro Bar on E. Lake Street. During that span, Chauvin failed to pay taxes on nearly $96,000 he earned from El Nuevo Rodeo alone, investigators estimated. Beginning in June 2019, he routinely worked off-duty at EME Antro Bar on weekends from 11 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. after his MPD shift and was paid $250 in cash each night, said investigators, who located no corresponding tax papers. On June 25, state revenue investigators searched the Chauvins’ Oakdale home, which was mostly empty. They recovered a box of tax documents, financial information and work schedules. Investigators also searched the home of Derek Chauvin’s father, an accountant who prepared their 2014 and 2015 tax returns based on information they provided him. The father said he filed an extension to do their 2016 returns, but that they never provided him with the information to complete them. Kellie Chauvin, also known as Kellie Xiong and who worked as a real estate agent and ran a photography business, told investigators that she had not prepared the returns because “it got away” from her, the complaints said. She was accompanied by an accountant who provided income tax returns for 2016 to 2019, but they appeared incomplete or estimated, the complaints continued. The complaints also said that on June 26, one day after their Oakdale home was searched, Kellie Chauvin called Derek Chauvin at the prison where he is being held. She told him during the recorded call that their unfiled tax returns were being investigated. She allegedly told her husband that she was meeting with someone about “[20]16 to now.” He then suggested using “who we have used to handle for many years.” She responded, “Yeah, well, we don’t want to get your dad involved, because he will just be mad at me, I mean us, not doing them for years.” Also Wednesday, Kellie Chauvin’s attorney requested that their divorce file be sealed, citing “constant harassment from the public.” “The circumstances surrounding Respondent’s incarceration has resulted in rage and violence throughout the community directed at both Petitioner and Respondent,” the filing said, adding that financial information and a Social Security number were hacked, resulting in attempts to secure cash advances for tens of thousands of dollars. “Allowing public access of this file will allow further harassment of Petitioner and not allow any privacy in this matter,” the filing said. “In addition, allowing public access will allow the public and media to have notice of when hearings occur and will allow the general public to know the whereabouts of each party during the proceedings. Such access will negatively affect the parties from a safety standpoint.” Staff writer Jennifer Bjorhus contributed to this report. Paul Walsh is a general assignment reporter at the Star Tribune.

officer fired,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/protesters-accuse-tampa-officers-of-harassment-renew-call-for-police-chief-to-be-fired/ar-BB179y1U,"Protesters accuse Tampa officers of harassment, renew call for police chief to be fired","TAMPA — A group of protesters, activists and residents accused Tampa’s police force of harassment and inaction while renewing their calls for police Chief Brian Dugan to be fired in a Friday morning news conference held outside City Hall. They highlighted two recent incidents involving officers taking excessive action, or not taking enough action: Among those who spoke were a woman who was held at gunpoint during a June 18 traffic stop, and a demonstrator whom a pick-up truck driver struck and injured on June 21. The injured protester is activist Jae Passmore, who has taken a prominent role in the Tampa protest movement — she rejects the term “leader” — and has criticized the lack of police response to the incident that left her requiring a wheelchair afterward. The driver has not been arrested. The other was Joneshia Wilkerson, who filmed a police officer who she said pointed a gun at her during a traffic stop. She said her life was upended when the Tampa Police Department released its own video of the incident — and in doing so publicized her personal information. Tampa police say they were investigating a report that the vehicle she was driving was stolen, and that she was not arrested. The Tampa Bay Times reached out to the Tampa Police Department and Castor’s office for comment on Friday’s news conference. A group of about two dozen protesters gathered at nearby Lykes Gaslight Park before marching to City Hall for the news conference. Many wore masks emblazoned with the phrase “Dump Dugan” and as they marched the short distance there, chanted: “When he lies, don’t let it slide; dump Dugan, bye, bye, bye.” Passmore, referring to her own June 21 ordeal, reiterated her belief that some of Dugan’s public comments during the Black Lives Matter protests — that frustrated motorists stuck in traffic due to protests should “start stepping up” — have emboldened “white supremacist vigilante violence.” Police say they are still investigating the incident, but have not released the driver’s name or said what led to the driver’s actions that day. However, using vehicles to attack protests is an anti-protester tactic commonly discussed online by white supremacists. Passmore also said that she believes she has been targeted by police during the now two-month long protest movement. She and her 5-year-old daughter were riding in a car stopped by officers July 16, she said, while she and other activists were driving home after planning to attend Mayor Jane Castor’s news conference, which was then moved online. The officers knew her name without checking her ID, Passmore said, which made her feel like they had targeted her. She said her daughter was terrified that the child was going to be shot or arrested. A Tampa police spokeswoman, given the date and location of the traffic stop described by Passmore, said officers filed no reports associated with the traffic stop. “My 5-year-old has already been traumatized by the police,” Passmore said. “And I don’t know how she’s going to recover.” Wilkerson said she also feels like a victim of police harassment starting last month, when she posted a video to Instagram of an officer pointing a pistol at her while she was parked in a driveway on June 18. Police said the vehicle was reported stolen out of Pinellas County. Wilkerson has said she borrowed the car from a friend who was financing it but apparently stopped making payments, which may have been why it was reported stolen. The police department said the officer pointed his weapon toward the vehicle, but not directly at the driver. The agency later posted video of an officer’s body-worn camera that captured her being handcuffed and questioned. But when police released it to counter Wilkerson’s own video, officials left audio of her giving her full name, address and phone number. The personal information of a woman who was riding with Wilkerson, however, was removed. Neither woman was arrested. Wilkerson, who serves in the Army Reserve, said that in the aftermath, she received threats and was forced to move out of her home. Since then, she said, she’s been homeless, living in hotels and out of her car. Tampa police deleted the video in late June. “The Tampa Police Department hasn’t reached out to me,” Wilkerson said. “They haven’t even said they’re sorry.” The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida has called for an investigation of the police department for publicizing Wilkerson’s information. Passmore said the city should take a step some protesters have been calling for for months: firing Dugan. Castor has said that she will not fire Dugan, who served on her command staff when she was chief of police. If that’s still the case, the activist said, then Castor should also step down. “How is she failing her own city?” Passmore said. “It’s inexcusable.” HOW TO SUPPORT: Whether you’re protesting or staying inside, here are ways to educate yourself and support black-owned businesses.

officer fired,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/21/detroit-officer-rubber-bullets-journalists-protest/5478529002/,Detroit police officer charged with felony assault after rubber bullets fired at journalists,"DETROIT – A Detroit police officer who the county prosecutor said fired rubber bullets at three journalists during a police brutality protest in downtown Detroit in May was charged Monday with multiple counts of felony assault. Daniel Debono, a 32-year-old corporal, had been suspended with pay while police investigated the accusation, Detroit Police Chief James Craig confirmed Monday during a news conference about an unrelated fatal shooting. ""The evidence shows that these three journalists were leaving the protest area and that there was almost no one else on the street where they were,"" Prosecutor Kym Worthy said. ""They were a threat to no one. There are simply no explicable reasons why the alleged actions of this officer were taken."" Debono faces three counts per victim. If convicted, Debono could be sentenced to up to four years in prison. The chief said Monday that he was aware that the charges could be coming since last week but not when they would be announced. He emphasized that the force investigated the case but that the prosecutor is the one who decided to bring charges. Typically, when charges are filed, Craig added, the suspension is changed to no pay. The one incident, he said, should not reflect on the whole department and how it has managed weeks of daily protests. Still, he acknowledged, the case is one of more than 20 allegations of misconduct against the department that are under investigation, adding that many of them are complaints that are difficult to look into because witnesses now have legal representation and are unwilling to be interviewed. Detectives also are still investigating protesters who are accused of property destruction and assaulting police officers. In Debono's case, sometime after midnight on May 31, after a protest against police brutality sparked by the high-profile death of George Floyd, Debono fired upon the three journalists after most protesters had dispersed, Worthy said. Debono was in riot gear, and in addition to his weapon that fired rubber pellets, he had his department-issued firearm. 'Unacceptable':St. Louis couple who waved guns at protesters face felony weapons charges The journalists – Nicole Hester, 30; Seth Herald, 28; and Matthew Hatcher, 29 – were covering the protest, Worthy said. They wore press credentials. They identified themselves as members of the press, had their hands up and asked to cross the street. As the three began to cross, Debono is accused of firing his weapon at them, striking all of three with rubber pellets. The shooting, Worthy said, was unprovoked. In addition, Worthy said, Herald's wrist was injured. Hatcher's face was bruised, with a mark on his nose, and more injuries to his ribs and Hester was hit in the face, neck, arms, and legs. Craig said that since the incident, the force has had conversations and training is ongoing – with constant debriefings. ""You've got to remember, we have a youthful workforce, and I don't know of a time in the recent past that we've had to deal with violent protesters,"" he said. ""So, by and large, this department performed in a spectacular manner."" Craig added that Detroit, unlike other major cities, has  avoided looting and burning, and while some officers have been injured and police cars have been damaged, most officers have acted ""very appropriately.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The former Minneapolis cop charged with murder in the May 25 death of George Floyd is now, along with his wife, facing tax evasion charges. Derek Chauvin, 46, and his wife, Kellie May Chauvin, 45, were each charged in Washington County on Wednesday with six counts of filing false or fraudulent tax returns for the tax years 2014 through 2019, and three counts of failing to file tax returns for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Chauvins’ underreported income from 2014 to 2019 totaled more than $464,000 and they allegedly owed nearly $22,000 in taxes, the Star Tribune reported. With interest, late filing and penalties, they now owe an estimated $37,868, according to the charges. Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for air. Chauvin was charged last month with second-degree murder and manslaughter. He and three other officers who were at the scene were fired. Chauvin is in custody on the charges in the Floyd case. Kellie Chauvin, who filed for divorce after Floyd's death, is not in custody. Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said the investigation into the Chauvins was started in June by the Minnesota Department of Revenue and Oakdale Police Department. Authorities allege in the criminal complaints that the Chauvins failed to file income tax returns and pay state income taxes, and that they underreported and underpaid taxes on income they earned from various jobs each year. The complaints allege that they also failed to pay proper sales tax on a $100,000 BMW purchased in Minnesota in 2018. Prosecutors say the Chauvins bought the car in Minnetonka but registered it in Florida, where they paid lower sales taxes. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Baytown Police Department has fired an officer who was caught on cell phone video roughing up a young man he had arrested for cursing. The Internal Affairs Division began investigating Nathaniel Brown after the video went viral leading to a protest outside the police department. The video shows Brown arresting 24-year-old Skylar Gilmore for “cussing in public,” then throwing him to the ground and kneeing him in the face. “This was my first time going to jail,” Gilmore said after the incident. “I’m a law-abiding citizen, and I got sent to jail for cursing.” After a review, Baytown Police Chief Keith Dougherty concluded Brown’s actions did not align with the department’s “professional standards and values.” ""The Baytown Police Department takes allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct by our officers very seriously,” the chief said in a statement. “The trust and confidence of our community is paramount and as such we hold our officers to the highest levels of integrity as well as moral, ethical and professional standards.” Gilmore was with his friends, Isaiah Benavides and Isaiah Phillips on June 2, when another friend, Jostin Moore, was pulled over in a separate car outside the Baytown Market Convenience Store. Benavides started recording the traffic stop where Moore was arrested for unspecified traffic violations and an outstanding warrant out of Deer Park. The three friends were questioning why Moore was being arrested. That’s when Brown handcuffed Gilmore “for cussing” and roughed him up, while a second officer grabbed Phillips from behind. “They slammed me on my friend Skylar’s hood, used my face to dent his hood,” Phillips said. “That’s not proper.” Baytown Police Chief Keith Dougherty filed the complaint against the officers. “I try to hold people accountable, and I feel the frustration,” Chief Dougherty said after the incident. It’s not clear if any action was taken against the second unidentified officer. Gilmore and Phillips were charged with disorderly conduct for using profanity. A separate charge of interfering with public duties was dropped because of lack of evidence. ALSO POPULAR ON KHOU.COM Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings."

In a statement, a police spokesperson said former officer Sean Pena was fired from his job on Wednesday. ""The process of ending Pena's employment with the City of Phoenix was finalized,"" Sgt. Ann Justus said. A three-count indictment accuses Sean Pena, 24, of having sex with one woman without her consent in August 2018 while she was in police custody. The indictment also accuses Pena of sexually assaulting a different woman who he was tasked to do a welfare check on in June 2019. In June, prosecutors filed one charge of sexual assault and two charges of unlawful sexual conduct. If found guilty on all three charges, he could face at least five years and a maximum of 19 years in prison. Pena made his first court appearance on July 17. He pleaded not guilty through his lawyer, Jess Lorona. A probable-cause statement says that in the 2018 case, a woman reported to Phoenix police that Pena arrested her at a park in connection to an outstanding warrant in Yavapai County. The woman told police that Pena forced her to have sex while she was handcuffed in the back of his patrol vehicle, the statement says. A rape kit was performed but Pena's DNA was not found on the swabs, the statement says. Surveillance video footage near where the assault occurred could not corroborate or refute the woman's allegations, the statement says. In the 2019 case, a woman reported to police that Pena forced her to masturbate him and touched her breast while they were alone, according to the statement. Pena had come into contact with the woman after someone called for a welfare check on her for wandering a street, the statement says. The court statement also says there was no biological evidence found by police to corroborate or refute the woman's claims. Pena has denied both women's allegations, according to the probable cause statement. Uriel Garcia covers public-safety issues in Arizona. Reach him at uriel.garcia@azcentral.com.

officer fired,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Lawsuit-Officer-fired-over-McClain-photo-denied-15427265.php,Lawsuit: Officer fired over McClain photo denied hearing,"DENVER (AP) — A suburban Denver police officer fired for his reaction to photos appearing to mock the death of a Black man who was stopped by police last year says he was denied a review hearing as required by city and police regulations, according to a lawsuit against officials. Jason Rosenblatt filed a lawsuit against Aurora Interim Police Chief Vanessa Wilson and Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly on July 2, the day before he was told he would be fired, asking a judge to declare that he had a right to an independent review board hearing. According to the lawsuit, first reported by KDVR-TV, Wilson said that a hearing was not required and that she had discretion as police chief not to hold one. The lawsuit requested that the court hold a hearing on the issue quickly to prevent “immediate and irreparable harm."" The status of the case now is not clear because Rosenblatt has already been fired over his reaction to the photos related to Elijah McClain's death. A spokesperson for the city would not comment on the case because of pending litigation. Rosenblatt's lawyer did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Rosenblatt, one of the officers who arrested McClain in August, received the photo depicting Kyle Dittrich, Erica Marrero and Jaron Jones smiling as they reenacted the chokehold their colleagues used on McClain, who died after police stopped him as he walked down the street in the Denver suburb of Aurora. Rosenblatt responded by text with “Haha.” Wilson launched an investigation into two photos taken by the officers after another officer reported that they were taken near where the 23-year-old was stopped — a site that’s now a memorial. She called the photos “a crime against humanity and decency.” Rosenblatt, Marrero and Dittrich were fired for conduct unbecoming of an officer. Jaron Jones resigned. Dittrich and Marrero filed appeals of their termination in early July with the Aurora Civil Service Commission. McClain’s death drew national attention in the wake of nationwide protests over police brutality and racial injustice. After facing increasing pressure, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis told the state attorney general to reopen the case in June after prosecutors last year declined to charge the three white officers who confronted McClain. On Monday, the Aurora city council announced a new independent investigator, Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, who will lead a three-person team to review the case. Aurora's previous investigative hire came under scrutiny for his previous work in law enforcement and was taken off the case Officers stopped McClain, a massage therapist, after a 911 call on Aug. 24, 2019, reported him because he was wearing a ski mask and flailing his arms. Police said they had a right to stop him because he was “being suspicious.” He begged them repeatedly to let go of him, according to body-camera video. Police placed him in a chokehold that cuts off blood to the brain, and paramedics administered 500 milligrams of a sedative to calm him down. He suffered cardiac arrest, then was later declared brain dead and taken off life support. Nieberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

			Aurora police officer fired over Elijah McClain photos sues city, interim chief		

	
	","GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. Jason Rosenblatt, one of three Aurora police officers fired over photos mocking the death of Elijah McClain, has sued the city and interim Chief Vanessa Wilson over his dismissal. Rosenblatt, who was one of the officers who restrained McClain before he died, had received the pictures taken by three other cops and replied “ha ha,” according to Wilson. Rosenblatt was not disciplined for his role in the death but was terminated July 3 after an investigation into the pictures. Two officers who appeared in the photos also were fired, and a third resigned before he was fired. The lawsuit, first reported Wednesday by Fox31, was filed July 2 after Wilson had told Rosenblatt she planned to fire him. City Manager Jim Twombly also is a defendant. In the complaint, Rosenblatt argued that Wilson wrongfully denied his request to take the disciplinary decision to the city’s Independent Review Board. The board, which has four civilian members and four police members, advises the police chief on officer discipline and is part of the city’s human resources department. During a July 3 news conference announcing the firings, Wilson said she had the discretion to deny a review board request and that she was within her powers as chief to terminate the officers. The lawsuit requested the judge make a quick decision in the case, but it has not been adjudicated. There’s no way to know whether an independent review board investigation would change the outcome of Rosenblatt’s tenure at the department but it most likely would have delayed a decision by months."

Shelton Police Department's Chief Shawn Sequeira speaks during Shelton High School's Shool Safety Community Forum in Shelton, Conn. on Tuesday Feb 27, 2018. SHELTON — Police Chief Shawn Sequeira fired three police officers: two for allegedly failing to properly investigate a domestic violence complaint against another police officer and the third for allegedly covering it up. Sequeira said an internal affairs investigation led to the termination of officers John Napoleone and Michael McClain and Lt. Dave Moore for dereliction of duty. Napoleone and Moore are the police union president and vice president, respectively. “Domestic violence should not be ignored … and I sincerely apologize to the reported victim,” Sequeira said. “The actions of these officers are not a reflection of the Shelton Police Department. We stand for professionalism, respect and integrity. No misconduct such as this will be tolerated.” The three Shelton officers were called to headquarters Monday afternoon and were asked to hand in their guns and clear out their lockers. Union attorney Barbara Resnick called the dismissals “completely baseless and without just cause.” Resnick said the officers will file grievances over the terminations. “This is a pretextual resurrection of an investigation done by the chief and command staff over a year ago that found no misconduct whatsoever on the officers’ part,” Resnick said. Sequeira said the initial internal affairs investigation began in August 2019 and was completed in November by Moore. The chief said the report, in which Moore cleared Napoleone and McClain, was found to be incomplete, leading to the additional internal affairs investigation. More disciplinary actions are expected before the investigation is closed, Sequeira said. The chief said Napoleone and McClain were fired for not properly investigating a complaint at the apartment of since-fired Bridgeport police officer Steven Figueroa and another Bridgeport police officer. Moore was fired, according to Sequeira, for attempting to “cover up” Napoleone and McClain’s “mishandling” of the incident. According to the Figueroa’s arrest affidavit, a neighbor at his apartment complex called in a disturbance around 4:45 a.m. June 29, 2019, that woke up her and her daughter. She told police it was a “loud fight” and that “she could hear someone was being thrown to the ground several times and a woman crying and screaming.” The witness told police, “the sounds were not that of just normal arguing, they were horrific and it sounded like extreme violence was taking place. I was in fear for the screaming woman and did not go back to sleep that night,” the affidavit said. Napoleone and McClain were sent to check out the call but, Sequeira said, failed to perform a complete investigation. The two officers knocked on the door but did not identify themselves as Shelton police officers, he said. The alleged victim later told police she heard knocks but could not respond because Figueroa had allegedly covered her mouth and threatened her if she made a sound, according to Sequeira. After Napoleone and McClain left, the victim was sexually assaulted, Sequeira said. “You neglected to properly investigate the reported domestic violence incident and your dereliction to duty caused further harm and serious injury to the victim,” Sequeira wrote in the termination letters to Napoleone and McClain. “The fact that you did not perform a complete and thorough investigation resulted in you failing to speak with the known complainant, identify the involved parties and examine their criminal history amongst other critical investigatory steps.” Figueroa had previously been arrested on breach of peace, harassment charges and for violation of a protective order. “A proper interview would have revealed the identity of the Bridgeport Officer involved who was actually on administrative leave and previously arrested four times for domestic violence for which his firearms were seized by Bridgeport Police Department,” Sequeira wrote. “Domestic violence is a very serious matter and it’s extraordinarily important the victims be able to trust law enforcement to do their job properly. Your actions/inactions allowed for a further assault to take place.” In the letters, Sequeira said “had it not been a Bridgeport Police Officer,” the investigation would have been handled differently. Figueroa was ultimately charged with first-degree sexual assault, third-degree assault, unlawful restraint, threatening, risk of injury to a child and violating conditions of release for the June 29, 2019, Shelton case. Those charges are pending in court. After Figueroa’s arrest, Shelton Police conducted an internal investigation, led by Moore, into the actions by Napoleone and McClain. Napoleone and McClain stated during that investigation that the noise the neighbor heard was probably coming from a loud television. Sequeira said a second internal affairs investigation — including a text message provided by the dispatcher — proved that the officers had details that the apartment was home to the Bridgeport officers and cast doubt that the noise the neighbor heard was from a TV. Moore’s investigation “knowingly and intentionally omitted vital information” in order to paint Napoleone and McClain in a better light, Sequeira said. “There is clear and convincing information that your investigation report contained untruthful statements, omitted statements, contained false & misleading information, and showed a lack of integrity, which appeared to be compromised by your close relationships with the subjects,” Sequeira wrote in Moore’s termination letter. Both Moore and McClain had been subject of numerous disciplinary measures, according to Sequeira, which also led to the decision to terminate. In one instance Moore allegedly failed to properly supervise an investigation of a school bus driver who was driving under the influence, his termination letter stated. Just like with the Figueroa incident, “it appears that the protection of fellow police officers is more important to you than the protection of the citizens of the City of Shelton,” Sequeira wrote. Mayor Mark Lauretti said Monday that he expected the investigation would result in more disciplinary actions against other police department staff. He also said “There has been this parochial protectionism inherent in the union mindset” when it comes to policing known law enforcement officers who live in a community. Lauretti said, at the end of the day, a woman was sexually assaulted. “You will see more heads roll,” the mayor said. “This is a sad commentary, especially knowing something could have been done to prevent that.” brian.gioiele@hearstmediact.com"

In a 911 call, a man said his roommate, later identified as 24-year-old Jovana Kelsey McCreary, was ""becoming crazy"" before he kicked her out. The man said McCreary shot a gun. The video shows two officers and a sergeant approaching McCreary at the scene, with one of them asking her if she had a firearm. She denied having or firing a gun and is heard telling a man who appeared to be the 911 caller to ""stay the (expletive) away from me."" She then tells officers she has proof that the man was threatening her and that another person had fired the gun. Officers talked with McCreary for nearly seven minutes and then searched her bag with her permission, finding ammunition and ""illegal drugs"" inside, according to a Phoenix police press release. They also discovered at that time that McCreary had an outstanding warrant for her arrest. She struggled to get away and pulled a handgun from her waist area as one of the officers tried to handcuff her. McCreary eventually fired the gun, which police said ""narrowly missed"" the officers. The two officers returned fire and struck McCreary twice. Officers performed first aid until Phoenix Fire Department personnel arrived and took her to the hospital. McCreary survived her injuries. No officers or bystanders were harmed. Both officers involved are assigned to the Cactus Park Precinct's Patrol Division, with one having 29 years and the other having 14 years of service with the department. Internal and criminal investigations are underway. Upon their completion, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office will review the case. The department said conclusions about whether the officers' actions are consistent with department policy and the law will not be made until the investigation is complete.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The former Minneapolis cop charged with murder in the May 25 death of George Floyd is now, along with his wife, facing tax evasion charges. Derek Chauvin, 46, and his wife, Kellie May Chauvin, 45, were each charged in Washington County on Wednesday with six counts of filing false or fraudulent tax returns for the tax years 2014 through 2019, and three counts of failing to file tax returns for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Chauvins’ underreported income from 2014 to 2019 totaled more than $464,000 and they allegedly owed nearly $22,000 in taxes, the Star Tribune reported. With interest, late filing and penalties, they now owe an estimated $37,868, according to the charges. Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died after Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for air. Chauvin was charged last month with second-degree murder and manslaughter. He and three other officers who were at the scene were fired. Chauvin is in custody on the charges in the Floyd case. Kellie Chauvin, who filed for divorce after Floyd's death, is not in custody. Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said the investigation into the Chauvins was started in June by the Minnesota Department of Revenue and Oakdale Police Department. Authorities allege in the criminal complaints that the Chauvins failed to file income tax returns and pay state income taxes, and that they underreported and underpaid taxes on income they earned from various jobs each year. The complaints allege that they also failed to pay proper sales tax on a $100,000 BMW purchased in Minnesota in 2018. Prosecutors say the Chauvins bought the car in Minnetonka but registered it in Florida, where they paid lower sales taxes. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Baytown Police Department has fired an officer who was caught on cell phone video roughing up a young man he had arrested for cursing. The Internal Affairs Division began investigating Nathaniel Brown after the video went viral leading to a protest outside the police department. The video shows Brown arresting 24-year-old Skylar Gilmore for “cussing in public,” then throwing him to the ground and kneeing him in the face. “This was my first time going to jail,” Gilmore said after the incident. “I’m a law-abiding citizen, and I got sent to jail for cursing.” After a review, Baytown Police Chief Keith Dougherty concluded Brown’s actions did not align with the department’s “professional standards and values.” ""The Baytown Police Department takes allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct by our officers very seriously,” the chief said in a statement. “The trust and confidence of our community is paramount and as such we hold our officers to the highest levels of integrity as well as moral, ethical and professional standards.” Gilmore was with his friends, Isaiah Benavides and Isaiah Phillips on June 2, when another friend, Jostin Moore, was pulled over in a separate car outside the Baytown Market Convenience Store. Benavides started recording the traffic stop where Moore was arrested for unspecified traffic violations and an outstanding warrant out of Deer Park. The three friends were questioning why Moore was being arrested. That’s when Brown handcuffed Gilmore “for cussing” and roughed him up, while a second officer grabbed Phillips from behind. “They slammed me on my friend Skylar’s hood, used my face to dent his hood,” Phillips said. “That’s not proper.” Baytown Police Chief Keith Dougherty filed the complaint against the officers. “I try to hold people accountable, and I feel the frustration,” Chief Dougherty said after the incident. It’s not clear if any action was taken against the second unidentified officer. Gilmore and Phillips were charged with disorderly conduct for using profanity.

Jason Rosenblatt filed a lawsuit against Aurora Interim Police Chief Vanessa Wilson and Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly on July 2, the day before he was told he would be fired, asking a judge to declare that he had a right to an independent review board hearing. According to the lawsuit, first reported by KDVR-TV, Wilson said that a hearing was not required and that she had discretion as police chief not to hold one. The lawsuit requested that the court hold a hearing on the issue quickly to prevent ""immediate and irreparable harm."" The status of the case now is not clear because Rosenblatt has already been fired over his reaction to the photos related to Elijah McClain's death. A spokesperson for the city would not comment on the case because of pending litigation. Rosenblatt's lawyer did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Rosenblatt, one of the officers who arrested McClain in August, received the photo depicting Kyle Dittrich, Erica Marrero and Jaron Jones smiling as they reenacted the chokehold their colleagues used on McClain, who died after police stopped him as he walked down the street in the Denver suburb of Aurora. Rosenblatt responded by text with ""Haha."" Wilson launched an investigation into two photos taken by the officers after another officer reported that they were taken near where the 23-year-old was stopped — a site that's now a memorial. She called the photos ""a crime against humanity and decency."" Rosenblatt, Marrero and Dittrich were fired for conduct unbecoming of an officer. Jaron Jones resigned. Dittrich and Marrero filed appeals of their termination in early July with the Aurora Civil Service Commission. McClain's death drew national attention in the wake of nationwide protests over police brutality and racial injustice. After facing increasing pressure, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis told the state attorney general to reopen the case in June after prosecutors last year declined to charge the three white officers who confronted McClain. On Monday, the Aurora city council announced a new independent investigator, Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, who will lead a three-person team to review the case. Aurora's previous investigative hire came under scrutiny for his previous work in law enforcement and was taken off the case Officers stopped McClain, a massage therapist, after a 911 call on Aug. 24, 2019, reported him because he was wearing a ski mask and flailing his arms. Police said they had a right to stop him because he was ""being suspicious."" He begged them repeatedly to let go of him, according to body-camera video. Police placed him in a chokehold that cuts off blood to the brain, and paramedics administered 500 milligrams of a sedative to calm him down. He suffered cardiac arrest, then was later declared brain dead and taken off life support. © 2020 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

In a statement, a police spokesperson said former officer Sean Pena was fired from his job on Wednesday. ""The process of ending Pena's employment with the City of Phoenix was finalized,"" Sgt. Ann Justus said. A three-count indictment accuses Sean Pena, 24, of having sex with one woman without her consent in August 2018 while she was in police custody. The indictment also accuses Pena of sexually assaulting a different woman who he was tasked to do a welfare check on in June 2019. In June, prosecutors filed one charge of sexual assault and two charges of unlawful sexual conduct. If found guilty on all three charges, he could face at least five years and a maximum of 19 years in prison. Pena made his first court appearance on July 17. He pleaded not guilty through his lawyer, Jess Lorona. A probable-cause statement says that in the 2018 case, a woman reported to Phoenix police that Pena arrested her at a park in connection to an outstanding warrant in Yavapai County. The woman told police that Pena forced her to have sex while she was handcuffed in the back of his patrol vehicle, the statement says. A rape kit was performed but Pena's DNA was not found on the swabs, the statement says. Surveillance video footage near where the assault occurred could not corroborate or refute the woman's allegations, the statement says. In the 2019 case, a woman reported to police that Pena forced her to masturbate him and touched her breast while they were alone, according to the statement. Pena had come into contact with the woman after someone called for a welfare check on her for wandering a street, the statement says. The court statement also says there was no biological evidence found by police to corroborate or refute the woman's claims. Pena has denied both women's allegations, according to the probable cause statement. Uriel Garcia covers public-safety issues in Arizona. Reach him at uriel.garcia@azcentral.com.

That has been corrected. NORMAN, Okla. (KFOR) – Norman Police Department officials are encouraging community members to wear a face mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and pledged that officers who don’t wear a mask will be disciplined. Norman police issued a news release Thursday concerning the vital importance of wearing a face mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as coronavirus cases continue to rise in Cleveland County. But officials started the news release by saying they will take action when an officer does not wear a mask in public. Officials said they are aware of recent complaints and concerns from community members regarding officers not wearing a face mask in public. “The department quickly addressed these concerns and those officers found acting not in compliance with the ordinance have received discipline from their supervisors,” the news release states. The Norman Fraternal Order of Police also took action by admonishing its members and encouraging each of them to wear a mask. Wearing a face covering and properly social distancing is essential in preserving public safety, according to Norman police. “I have noticed that the majority of our community is wearing a mask or face covering when in a public place where social distancing is not possible as well as inside businesses,” said Norman Police Chief Kevin Foster. “I want to express my appreciation to those who are acting in accordance with the ordinance and ask others, even if you disagree with the mandate, to wear a mask when in public and around other community members. I also appreciate residents kindly encouraging their family, friends and neighbors to wear a face covering while out in the public.” The Norman City Council recently passed the ordinance requiring community members to wear face coverings in public places. The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported on Thursday that there have been 23,441 positive cases of COVID-19 in Oklahoma since March. Of those total statewide cases, 1,576 have been in Cleveland County. 40 people in Cleveland County have died from COVID-19. The mask ordinance will be enforced through an education first approach, according to the news release. “Individuals refusing to wear a face covering in a Place of Public Accommodation or Public Setting may be cited for criminal trespass, disturbing the peace, interference with official process, or similar offenses as circumstances warrant,” the news release states.

            City of Buffalo blocked from releasing portions of police disciplinary records
        
    ","The city's police and firefighter unions filed a lawsuit this week seeking to halt the public disclosure of portions of police officers' and firefighters' disciplinary records. A judge on Friday temporarily blocked the City of Buffalo from publicly releasing three types of records in employees' disciplinary files: unsubstantiated allegations, pending allegations and matters that were the subject of confidential settlement agreements. State Supreme Court Justice Frank A. Sedita III issued a temporary restraining order that prohibits the city and the police and fire departments from releasing such information. Sedita scheduled a hearing on the matter for next month. In June, following a change in state law known as ""50-A,"" the disciplinary records of police officers and firefighters were no longer permitted to be withheld from public requests made through the Freedom of Information Law. That change, aimed at increasing transparency, was prompted by nationwide protests and calls for police reform following the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. But attorneys for the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association and Buffalo Professional Firefighters Association, Local 282, argue the city should still be bound from releasing information about disciplinary matters involving unsubstantiated or pending allegations, or subject to confidential settlement agreements, based on other legal protections. Those include the local union contracts and the state constitution. ""No actual evidence is required to make a complaint against a Buffalo police officer or firefighter,"" the unions' attorneys wrote in court papers. ""False or otherwise meritless claims can be brought against members of the police and fire departments based on any number of nefarious or malicious motivations."" Making public the records of those types of complaints – which attorneys said were unproven ""at best, and which are entirely false allegations against them at worst"" – destroys an individual's reputation and privacy, as well as makes them less safe, attorneys John J. Gilmour and Daniel M. Killelea wrote. Earlier this month, the police department began releasing disciplinary records based on Freedom of Information Law requests. In many cases, the department has provided what the department calls an officer's ""disciplinary card."" These documents include some identifying information about the employee, as well as a chart listing the type of complaint, the date an internal affairs case was opened and the disposition of the case. The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday, does not seek to block the release of full complaint history found in employees' disciplinary records. The police union says it made an agreement with the city in May 2018 that the department would remove from an officer's records after five years ""information concerning complaints which did not result in members' guilty pleas or findings of guilt."" One set of disciplinary records that were released earlier this month were those of Buffalo Police Lt. Michael DeLong, who was recorded on video in late June calling the woman recording him a vulgar name. The police union filed a grievance July 10 alleging the 2018 agreement was violated in DeLong's case because what was released contained information that should have been removed, according to court documents filed as part of the lawsuit. The union also filed a grievance Tuesday on behalf of an unspecified number of other officers whose records were released by the department a day earlier. In addition to seeking to prevent the release of pending or unsubstantiated allegations, the unions' lawsuit seeks to block the city from releasing disciplinary records that are subject to confidential settlement agreements made prior to June 12, when the change to 50-A went into effect. The disciplinary cards of police officers obtained by The Buffalo News through Freedom of Information Law requests have included no details on the incidents that led to the complaints. The records list the type of complaint. Some of the categories are excessive force; racial profiling; violation of departmental procedures, including cases involving motor vehicle accidents and calling in sick; off-duty conduct; and harassing conduct. The records have included a variety of dispositions, including complaints that are not sustained and when an officer is deemed exonerated. A city spokesman declined comment. A federal judge in New York City issued a similar ruling this week in a lawsuit involving police and other public safety unions. Get the latest in local public safety news with this weekly email.

		Judge blocks release of New York police discipline records	","WETM - MyTwinTiers.com NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge has halted the public release of police officer disciplinary records in New York, temporarily turning back a state transparency reform enacted in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. Judge Katherine Polk Failla granted a temporary restraining order late Wednesday barring police departments and other entities in the state from disclosing discipline records until at least Aug. 18, when she’ll hear arguments in a union lawsuit challenging their release. Failla took over the case when it was transferred from state court, extending and expanding an existing stay that paused public disclosure of records concerning unsubstantiated and non-finalized allegations or settlement agreements. The Police Benevolent Association, representing New York City police officers and other public safety unions, sued the city on July 15 to block Mayor Bill de Blasio from making good on a promise to post a database of misconduct complaints online. The unions argued that posting unproven or false complaints could sully officers’ reputations and compromise their safety. “The battle to protect the safety and due process right of public safety officers and police goes forward,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a spokesperson for the union coalition. A lawyer for the city’s police watchdog agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, said the ruling is blocking the agency from “making the public aware of complaints against the people who are supposed to be protecting them.” Matthew Kadushin, the agency’s general counsel, said he’s confident the city will prevail. In issuing the temporary restraining order, Failla also barred the New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union from publicly releasing records it had already obtained in the wake of last month’s repeal of the law keeping them secret, finding that the organization had somehow been “acting in concert” with city government. The organization, which often tangles with the city in court, said it obtained officer misconduct complaints from the CCRB under the state’s open records law. The NYCLU said it received the records before the union’s lawsuit was filed and was not a party to it. “The federal court has no authority to bar us from making it public, and we will contest this unprecedented order as quickly as possible,” said Christopher Dunn, the organization’s legal director. “With the repeal of section 50-a, the public is entitled to have access to complete information about police misconduct, and we have an absolute right to share with the public the information we have.” New York lawmakers, spurred to action last month by protests over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis and other police misconduct, repealed the 50-a law that for decades blocked the public disclosure of disciplinary records for police officers, as well as firefighters and correctional officers. While the law was on the books, the officers’ unions sued to make it even more restrictive so that the public and even the victims of police misconduct couldn’t learn the outcomes of internal discipline hearings. In the wake of the repeal, the CCRB moved quickly to respond to requests for the newly available records — a process now on hold because of the temporary restraining order. The NYPD, which also probes complaints through its internal affairs bureau, has yet to respond to requests from The Associated Press and other news media outlets for its disciplinary records.

            Officer who killed Black man says he feared for his life
        
    ","PHOENIX (AP) — An Arizona state trooper who killed a Black man nearly two months ago during a roadside struggle in Phoenix said he fired his gun because he feared for his life as the man refused to let go of the officer’s arm that was holding the firearm, according to police reports released earlier this week. Trooper George Cervantes, whose fatal shooting of Dion Johnson inspired marches against police violence in Phoenix, told investigators that a partially handcuffed Johnson had already pulled part of the officer’s body into the car through an open door. He said he feared he would lose control of his gun if Johnson continued to overpower him, so he shot Johnson in the torso, leading to his death. The reports provide new details on the officer’s account of the May 25 shooting along the Loop 101 freeway. Authorities also released records showing Cervantes received an 80-hour suspension in 2013 for a series of violations of policy. The violations included shooting his girlfriend’s puppy with a stun gun in an attempt to discipline the pet and using a state vehicle to leave a note on the car of his former girlfriend, who had been at odds with him and found the anonymous note to be worrisome. Efforts to contact Cervantes for comment through phone records and social media weren’t successful. A message left for Jocquese Blackwell, an attorney representing Johnson’s family, wasn’t immediately returned Friday. Thousands of demonstrators took the street in downtown Phoenix last month to protest the deaths of Johnson and George Floyd, who died on the same day as Johnson as Minneapolis police tried to arrest him. The reports say Johnson’s encounter with Cervantes started when the trooper saw Johnson passed out in a car that smelled of alcohol and had a handgun sitting on the seat. A toxicology report shows Johnson had methamphetamine, the synthetic opioid fentanyl and marijuana in his system. The officer took the gun and secured it on his motorcycle and then returned to the car to arrest Johnson, who was by then seen moving around. Cervantes cuffed one of Johnson’s hands, marking the beginning of the struggle, according to the reports. The officer said he feared that Johnson was going to push him into a lane of traffic with his legs, so he pulled out his gun and told him to stop resisting arrest or he would be shot. Cervantes said he started to re-holster his gun when he felt the threat had lessened, but then Johnson grabbed his arm that was holding the officer’s gun. The officer told investigators that Johnson leaned back, pulled on the trooper and used his legs as leverage to pull part of the officer’s body into the vehicle through an open door. The trooper also said he feared Johnson would get hold of his gun if he were further drawn into the car, so he shot Johnson. About seven years ago, Cervantes acknowledged to internal affairs investigators that he shot his then-girlfriend’s Boxer puppy with a department-issued stun gun because the pet was digging holes in her yard. Authorities say Cervantes also drove his patrol vehicle to a parking lot where he left an anonymous note on his ex-girlfriend’s vehicle saying, “I see you. I know where you live.” His former girlfriend was frightened because she thought she was being stalked, leading police to open an investigation. Investigators said Cervantes claimed the note was a joke. Cervantes, a 15-year veteran of The Arizona Department of Public Safety, was put on paid leave after Johnson’s death. Prosecutors are reviewing Johnson’s death to determine whether charges are warranted. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

officer disciplinary,https://whyy.org/articles/new-police-reform-law-exempts-officer-disciplinary-records-database-from-public-disclosure/,New police reform law exempts officer disciplinary records database from public disclosure,"Planet Money is on a quest to explain the economy with playful storytelling and deep dive, roll up your sleeves journalism. How I Built This host Guy Raz talks to entrepreneurs and idealists who take us through the often challenging journeys they took to build their businesses. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf says two bills into law, making changes to certain aspects of law enforcement, on July 14, 2020. (Ed Mahon / PA Post) This story originally appeared on PA Post. A new law signed by Governor Tom Wolf will give Pennsylvania police departments greater access to disciplinary records for officers during the hiring process. It creates a statewide database of separation records, including criminal charges filed against an officer, ethical or civil complaints, and binding and final disciplinary actions. Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies are required to search the database when hiring a new officer, and backers of the measure say it’s aimed at preventing deaths like the 2018 killing of 17-year-old Antwon Rose II in East Pittsburgh. The goal is to give local agencies the ability to dig into job candidates’ backgrounds. Act 57 swiftly moved through the Pennsylvania General Assembly after nationwide protests over the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd while in police custody. Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association and the Pennsylvania FOP, endorsed the the new law. But the new law provides only limited access to that information for members of the public, specifically exempting most of the employment records in the database from the state’s Right-to-Know Law. Some states provide more public access to police officer disciplinary records. In 2015, WNYC found that 12 states make disciplinary records generally available to the public, another 15 make those documents available in some situations, and 23, including Pennsylvania, make them confidential. Last month, New Jersey’s governor and attorney general took action to make public more disciplinary information about police officers. New Jersey State Police said it would publish the name of all all state troopers, over the past 20 years, who received suspensions of more than 180 days or whose employment was terminated as a result of misconduct. Meanwhile, the N.J. attorney general’s office said it would require all law enforcement agencies to publish the names of law enforcement officers who have been terminated, demoted, or suspended for more than five days. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said he supports making more information about disciplinary records public, but he said Act 57 is focused on the hiring process. He said representatives for the public, whether it’s a police chief or mayor, will have access to disciplinary information under the law. “They can then be held accountable by the public for the decision that they make,” Shapiro said at a bill signing news conference outside the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency office in  Harrisburg. “That’s where the transparency comes in. That’s where meaningful change comes.” Act 57 does say some information should be disclosed to the broader public. If a law enforcement agency chooses to hire someone who has received final and binding discipline or been criminally convicted for any of 10 types of behavior, then the hiring agency is required to file a report “that indicates the … reasoning and rationale” for hiring the person. Wolf, a Democrat, characterized the two bills he signed as small, but important steps “toward what we have to do to make our society fair."" The 10 types of behavior that require a hiring report are: excessive force, harassment, theft, discrimination, sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, domestic violence, coercion of a false confession, filing a false report and a judicial finding dishonest. The law says those hiring reports, which must be submitted to the Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission, are “subject to disclosure” under the Right-to-Know law. State Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) said this level of  transparency will increase accountability and make it less likely that law enforcement agencies will hire people with red flags. “In that hiring report, they’re going to have to explain why they ignored these red flags,” Rabb said.  “Now what happens when you ask a law enforcement agency, why did you hire this person? Do you think the chief of police wants to answer those questions?” Still, even though the law says hiring reports are covered by the Right-to-Know Law, an attorney with the Pennsylvania News Media Association, Melissa Melewsky, said it’s not clear how much information agencies will release. She said agencies could still review the hiring reports and decide that parts shouldn’t be released because of existing exemptions in the open records law. “There’s a lot to be figured out here when it’s put into practice,” Melewsky said. Erik Arneson, executive director of the state’s Office of Open Records, which hears appeals in open records cases for most agencies, said he thinks the law clearly requires agencies to release the full, unredacted hiring report. “The legislative intent, it seems to me, is crystal clear,” Arneson said. The law does not specify what details law enforcement agencies have to provide in those hiring reports. Arneson said he expects law enforcement agencies will vary across the state in how they handle these hiring reports, but he recommends they provide significant detail to explain the decision. “If somebody decides to take a very minimalistic approach to putting together one of these reports, I think that’s just going to lead to more questions,” Arneson said. “In cases like this, experience has taught us that it is very smart to get out in front of it and do a full, credible job upfront, rather than having to backfill later on when questions emerge.” Wolf on Tuesday also signed into law Act 59, which requires law enforcement officers to undergo mental health evaluations after using deadly force. Several Democratic lawmakers said Wolf’s signing of the two bills represented a first but significant step for law enforcement reforms. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are waiting on the House Judiciary Committee to take action on a bill that would require police departments to adopt use-of-force policies that ban choke holds to detain someone, and a bill that would require law enforcement agencies submit information to state police about incidents when officers use force. Tuesday’s signing came a little over a month after Black Democratic lawmakers protested on the Pa. House floor. “For too often African-American legislators in the statehouse have been overlooked. Their issues have been overlooked,” said state Rep. Jason Dawkins (D-Philadelphia). “Their folks that they represent back home have been overlooked. And we decided no more. So we decided to do something about it.” Listen anytime, anywhere. Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said the restraint was ""reasonable."" The decision has set up a confrontation between the federal government’s directives, the state legislature’s intent, and the governor’s powers. Wolf withheld nearly $13 million in funding from Lebanon County, where local Republican leaders voted in mid-May to lift pandemic restrictions in defiance of the governor.

Police Chief Greg Peterson announced the decision Thursday following a nearly two-month long investigation into posts by officer Bryce La Luzerne that were reported to the department at the end of May. Peterson said that since the comments were made prior to La Luzerne joining the force in 2017, he was not bound by the department's code of conduct. In addition, an investigation into La Luzerne's conduct as an officer found ""that the allegations presented in the anonymous complaint have not been exhibited in any aspect of Officer La Luzerne's performance with the Grand Chute Police Department since his date of hire,"" Peterson wrote. La Luzerne's social media posts prompted a protest outside the police station at the beginning of July, where about 50 people gathered to demand the department fire him. Tweets pictured in screenshots shared on Facebook date back to between 2011 and 2014 and use racial slurs, homophobic language and mention murder. The department also examined a more recent post La Luzerne made on Instagram in October. The post shows a photo of a handgun and references the Boogaloo movement, which has ties to white supremacy and radical libertarianism, according to USA TODAY. As part of the investigation, the department reviewed La Luzerne's social media and internet search history, his hiring process, arrest record, use of force incidents and complaints filed against him. The department also conducted interviews with people who knew La Luzerne in high school. The investigation did not reveal evidence of bias or prejudice, Peterson said. He said the department decided to conduct a ""meticulous"" investigation to uphold the community's trust in the department, though he recognized that trust has already been damaged ""based solely on the egregious nature of the allegations."" ""The comments shared by Officer La Luzerne as a teenager were reprehensible,"" Peterson wrote. ""Making no excuse for his conduct, he is in full agreement, stating so in a written apology he has given me. Acknowledging the pain arising from his actions, he has also expressed his desire to 'restore the trust and repair the damage' that his past words have caused. We share in this sentiment.""

Tyron Andrepont, who was booked in June with five counts malfeasance in office. According to a notice from Opelousas Mayor Julius Alsindor, the council will meet on Monday, July 20 at the council chambers for the purpose of holding a pre-disciplinary hearing for Andrepont. The council will then enter into executive session to discuss Andrepont's character and profesional competence. At the end of that hearing, the council will consider whether discipline will be entered against Andrepont. On Tuesday, the council rejected Andrepont's resignation and formally ended the officer's paid leave. The rejection means that the officer could be fired. Andrepont was booked on June 9 on five counts of malfeasance in connection with the alleged beating of an Opelousas teen in a hospital last year. ------------------------------------------------------------Stay in touch with us anytime, anywhere.

          NYCLU Challenges Judge's Order Blocking Them From Releasing Database Of NYPD Disciplinary Records
        
","© 2020 New York Public Radio. All rights reserved. The New York Civil Liberties Union has challenged a federal judge's gag order that is currently preventing them from publishing a vast database containing police disciplinary records. The searchable database—that contains data provided by the Civilian Complaint Review Board through a Freedom of Information request—was expected to be unveiled yesterday, according to court filings from the NYCLU. The rollout was made possible after state lawmakers repealed the 50-A provision that for decades has kept police disciplinary records secret. But on Wednesday night, federal judge Katherine Polk Failla temporarily blocked its release, siding with a group of police unions who have sued the City, arguing that public disclosure of ""unsubstantiated"" complaints would irrevocably damage the reputations of officers. The NYCLU is not named in the unions’ suit and obtained the records on its own, and argued that the court had no ability to prevent it from publishing the materials. But Judge Failla claimed that the non-profit had somehow colluded with the CCRB and the City, and blocked the NYCLU from releasing them. In their filings, the NYCLU says the gag order violates its First Amendment, citing the Pentagon Papers case where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that institutions can release sensitive government documents without being censored. ""The obvious and central point that we are making is that order is unconstitutional. It's a prior restraint on our right to publish information we lawfully have and we certainly hope and expect it will be lifted quickly,” said Christopher Dunn, legal director for the NYCLU, which filed the court papers late Thursday night. “The NYCLU obtained police misconduct data lawfully, and we vehemently disagree with the court’s unprecedented order to bar the publishing of these records,” said NYCLU executive director, Donna Lieberman. “For years, the NYPD invoked 50-a to hide disciplinary records and sidestep meaningful accountability. Now that 50-a has been repealed, the police unions are attempting to continue their campaign to keep police misconduct hidden. We’ll keep fighting to bring police misconduct into the light of day and make sure police are held accountable.” Given case law that would side with the NYCLU, Dunn expects the order to be lifted quickly. The unions must file their response by Friday, then Judge Failla will make a decision. “Every day that this is delayed, is a day that they feel is a better day. But you can rest assured that we and our allies are going to be working very hard to get this information out,” said Dunn.

officer disciplinary,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/508882-justice-dept-finds-alabama-corrections-officers-used-excessive-force-on,DOJ finds Alabama corrections officers used excessive force on prisoners,"Corrections officers in the Alabama prison system used excessive force on prisoners in a series of incidents, according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) report released Thursday. The report found that Alabama corrections officers frequently use excessive and sometimes deadly force in violation of inmates' constitutional rights in 12 out of 13 prisons the DOJ reviewed. Investigators found “reasonable cause to believe that the uses of excessive force occurring within Alabama’s prisons give rise to systemic unconstitutional conditions.” Corrections officers used batons, chemical spray and physical actions such as kicking and beating to discipline inmates, leading to serious injuries and at least two deaths last year. One of those incidents occurred in October 2019, where investigators found “the level of force used caused the prisoner to sustain multiple fractures to his skull, including near his nose, both eye sockets, left ear, left cheekbone, and the base of his skull, many of which caused extensive bleeding in multiple parts of his brain.” “The autopsy listed 16 separate and distinct injuries to the prisoner’s head and neck, in addition to multiple fractured ribs and bleeding around a kidney,” the report found. According to investigators, in one instance a corrections officer told an inmate, “I am the reaper of death, now say my name!” as the inmate was being beaten. The prisoner reportedly begged the officer to kill him. The pattern of abuse came to light after a series of civil rights lawsuits against the Alabama prison system over the years, including litigation filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). “The violent conditions and circumstances outlined in the DOJ’s latest report are at the hands of prison personnel and demonstrate failures of the Alabama Department of Corrections’ leadership to ensure people in their custody are safe,” Ebony Howard, the SPLC's senior supervising attorney, said in a statement. “This unconstitutional behavior will not be solved by building newer, larger prisons.” The report gave Alabama officials 49 days to address the concerns detailed by the DOJ, warning the attorney general may sue. Alabama's Republican Attorney General Steve Marshall has said he is against the state entering into a legal agreement with the federal government over prison conditions. He said the state was ""ambushed"" by the report and that they have ""never denied the challenges that the Alabama Department of Corrections is facing."" ""Alabama will not be bullied into a perpetual consent decree to govern our prison system, nor will we be pressured to reach such an agreement with federal bureaucrats, conspicuously, fifty-three days before a presidential election,"" Marshall said in a statement.

The task force was established by County Executive Angela Alsobrooks following the release of an explosive expert witness report, written by a respected law enforcement leader, that detailed over two dozen instances where white PGPD officers engaged in racist conduct with no or minimal discipline, including for the use of racial epithets and other derogatory language or circulated offensive imagery. Lt. Thomas Boone, President of the United Black Police Officers Association, said: “We are determined to see all the way through the changes needed to end racial discrimination within the Prince George’s Police Department, which needs much more than just replacing the chief in charge.  We need a police force that has more diversity throughout the ranks and specialty units, that has a fair promotions system not filled with bias, and that is representative of the community it protects.” In June, Mike Graham, a former assistant sheriff with the LA County Sheriff’s Office with significant U.S. Department of Justice experience, filed an expert witness report in federal court in Maryland in HNLEA vs. Prince George’s County that made clear what Black and Brown officers have been saying for years: PGPD has a pattern and practice of unconstitutional conduct. Following release of the report, Henry Stawinski, the white PGPD police chief under whose leadership Black and Brown officers experienced extensive discrimination in recent years, was forced to resign. In addition, the task force, chaired by Judge Maureen Lamasney and Delegate Alonzo Washington, was charged to make recommendations on hiring, training, and use of force in policing. Ret. Cpt. Joe Perez, President of the Hispanic National Law Enforcement Association, said: “Ending racial bias against Black and Brown officers within the Prince George’s Police Department goes hand in hand with better relationships in the community. Civilian complaints need to be taken seriously, and supervisors need to be held accountable for better monitoring of officer interactions with community members. And we can no longer allow policies and practices that turn a blind eye to racial profiling, which has been shamefully ignored by PGPD leadership for years.” Jonathan Smith, Executive Director of the Washington Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights & Urban Affairs, said: “Fair, equitable, and effective policing requires that there is shared trust between police officers, their police department and the many and diverse communities that live in the county.  A critical component of trust building is genuine engagement between the public and the department that begins with candor and transparency. The recommendations of the Hispanic National Law Enforcement Association and the United Black Police Officers Association if seriously considered and addressed will be an important beginning to rebuilding trust between the Prince Georges County Police Department and communities that they serve.” The plaintiffs are represented by John Freedman, Adam Pergament, Mei-Wah Lee, and Preston Smith from Arnold & Porter; Jonathan Smith, Dennis Corkery, Joanna Wasik, and Tristin Brown from the Washington Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights & Urban Affairs, and Deborah Jeon from the ACLU of Maryland."
officer disciplinary,https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/judge-temporarily-blocks-release-of-buffalo-police-disciplinary-records,Judge temporarily blocks release of Buffalo Police disciplinary records,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — The unions representing Buffalo police and firefighters have been granted a temporary block on the public release of disciplinary records that are pending, unsubstantiated, or have resulted in a ""not guilty"" finding. State Supreme Court Justice Frank A. Sedita III issued a temporary restraining order on the City of Buffalo on Friday. In court filings, the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association and Buffalo Professional Firefighters Association argue that the release of all disciplinary records could do irreparable harm to the officers or firefighters and their families, because some of the records are unsubstantiated. ""The disclosure of Unsubstantiated and Pending Allegations without due process of law is functionally irreversible, and will create unfair, unlawful, and unending notoriety for [union members] and their members, with a significant impact upon  their future employment prospects,"" the petition argues. The petition goes a step further, arguing that the release of records could ""imperil the safety"" of police officers and firefighters. The City of Buffalo has until August 14th to submit opposition letters to the court. This lawsuit by the police and firefighter unions is in response to New York's appeal of Section 50-A of New York's Civil Rights Law in an effort to promote transparency in law enforcement across the state. Since 50-A was appealed, Buffalo Police have been inundated with Freedom of Information Law requests for officers' disciplinary records. Buffalo's Common Council has asked Buffalo Police for all complaints filed against police officers over the past five years."

New numbers: Coming off a weekend with high numbers, the number of newly reported confirmed and probable coronavirus cases in Ohio was 1,261 on Monday, Laura Hancock reports. That means the state now has at least 66,853 cases and 3,064 deaths. Cleveland numbers: The Ohio Department of Health has notified Cleveland that 66 more residents have been confirmed as having COVID-19 coronavirus. Robert Higgs reports the city now has 3,248 confirmed cases.

Cory Shaffer reports that McGrath suspended veteran patrolman Scott Aldridge for 10 days, the minimum time allowable under the city’s discipline structure, and issued a written reprimand to rookie officer Bryan Myers. Akron masks: Akron City Council on Monday voted to approve legislation requiring people to wear a mask or face covering in public under most circumstances to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Robin Goist reports.

police lawsuit,https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/jul/22/family-excessive-force-negligence-metro-gomez-suit/,"In lawsuit, family claims excessive force, negligence by Metro in Jorge Gomez death","Jeanne Llera, mother of Jorge Gomez, responds to a question about her son’s death during a news conference at the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse in downtown Las Vegas Wednesday, July 22, 2020. Gomez was shot and killed by Metro Police officers in front of the courthouse during a George Floyd protest on June 1, 2020. Wednesday, July 22, 2020 | 8:45 p.m. Adequate training would’ve prevented a series of events that ended in the shooting death of a protester at the hands of Metro Police officers as a George Floyd-inspired protest ended last month, his family alleges in a federal lawsuit to be filed this week. Jorge Gomez’s family, a team of lawyers and community activists gathered Wednesday on the steps of the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse, near where officers gunned him down, to not only announce the legal action against Metro, but to share messages of “who he is and who he was not.” Allegations in the 21-page complaint include excessive use of force, negligence and wrongful death, accusing Metro of failing to train its officers and denying medical care to a wounded Gomez, 25, the night of his death, according to attorney Rodolfo Gonzalez. The four officers who opened fire are individually named in the lawsuit. Rivaling narratives emerged following the shooting in downtown Las Vegas, after police ordered the rowdy protest dispersed late on June 1. Gomez, who was open-carrying two guns, approached officers standing atop the federal courthouses steps, where he was ordered to leave before one of them hit him with bean bags, Metro said. Subsequently, as Gomez ran away, four officers who were driving by got out and opened fire when he pointed a long gun at them. Since the Metro officers weren’t regular patrol officers, they weren’t required to wear body cameras. Metro only provided a grainy, short video that shows an officer confront Gomez at the steps before he is seen running away. The officers who shot Gomez were on their way to the unrelated shooting of Officer Shay Mikalonis, who was shot in the head on the Strip while trying to break up another group of protesters, police said. Investigators found two loaded guns on Gomez and one concealed in his backpack. He was also wearing a tactical vest. Police said he didn’t fire any rounds. Gomez’s family and their legal team see the video in another light. Gomez was leaving the protest and was harassed as he was walking toward his car, they allege. His last message to his father, a K9 security officer, was moments before the shooting, and said, “Father, I’m on my way to go pick you up,” attorney Edgar Flores said. The elder Gomez, who was at work, had loaned his son the car that day and was waiting to be picked up. He never made it. A staunch supporter of the First and Second Amendments, Gomez was exercising his right to protest and open-carry, they said. Investigators only spoke to the family once shortly after the shooting, they said. Metro initially said Gomez was growing increasingly radicalized and that his family had expressed concern. His family contends that was not the case and that they were only concerned for his safety at the protest. They describe Gomez as an amiable and kind person who displayed his true nature when he hugged a woman at the same rally. She was protesting her son’s death by Metro officers. Carol Luke told the Sun that Gomez told her to keep telling her son’s story. On his Facebook page, Gomez published anti-Donald Trump messages and wrote about the police brutality protests. He posted a vague message of a revolution. Gomez’s family is also demanding that Metro release more footage, noting that at least a dozen cameras surround the area where their loved one was slain. They say their attempts to obtain further video or investigative documents from Metro and the other local police agencies have been futile. They have also tried contacting federal officials to see which agencies might’ve been at the protest, they said. “It appears that if you want to get some type of justice, some transparency, a lawsuit is the only thing that will get them to do that,” Flores, the attorney, said. Metro officer shootings require those involved go through two reviews that could take months. One looks at any possible criminal activity against the officers, and the other scrutinizes the policies, whether they were followed, or if they need to be amended. Metro spokesman Larry Hadfield said the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation and didn’t offer any updates on the investigation. “There has to be better training and accountability,” Flores said. “Law enforcement needs to know that they can hold themselves accountable and that it’s OK ... that is how you gain the trust of the community, when you hold each other accountable.” The lawsuit is “larger than us,” said Flores, noting that it wasn’t only about Gomez or even Floyd, but “every single person that’s lost their life and they didn’t get their time in front of the camera ... and nobody screamed (their) name on the street like we’re doing today.” Those present at the news conference Wednesday wore themed T-shirts demanding justice for Gomez and held black-and-white copies of a portrait showing him smiling. Posters showcased him at various stages of his life. Gomez loved avocados, so family members and lawyers wore green avocado-themed face coverings. Jeanne Llera took to the microphone to describe her son. She said Gomez, who was born in Orlando, Florida, knew Las Vegas from several years ago when the family relocated after his father got a job here when he was a child. After graduating high school in Orlando, he was itching to go back West. He eventually moved to Oregon and got two jobs as he waited to go back to school to be a veterinary pathologist. Gomez lost both jobs when the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. He moved to Las Vegas to be with his father. And then he saw the footage of a Minneapolis police officer digging his knee into George Floyd’s neck while Floyd pleaded that he couldn’t breathe, they said. The death sparked nationwide protests, even in the middle of a pandemic, and they occurred here, too. Gomez grabbed his guns and hit the streets in protest at least once before the night he was killed, police and family said. Llera said the family wants Metro to be transparent about why they shot her son, noting that she’s not asking them for a “miracle” in bringing him back to life. “I just wish,” she said, her voice trailing as she began to cry."

The recommendations include the adoption of an affirmative-action plan to make the police force more “representative of the community it serves,” along with residency requirements for department leaders and incentives for rank-and-file officers to live in Prince George’s. The groups also recommended greater accountability in internal-affairs investigations and additional training around discrimination, retaliation, harassment and implicit bias. The ideas were sent in a letter to the members of the county’s task force on police reform. County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) created the task force this month as Prince George’s battles allegations of discrimination within the police department and amid nationwide calls for police reform after George Floyd was killed in the custody of Minneapolis officers. The two groups recommending the 12-point plan are the United Black Police Officers Association (UBPOA) and the Hispanic National Law Enforcement Association (HNLEA), whose members sued the county in 2018 alleging workplace discrimination. The lawsuit — which asserts the police department disproportionately disciplines minority officers — has not been resolved. “I know that we can do better for both the citizens of Prince George’s County and the officers that work for Prince George’s,” Joe Perez, the president of HNLEA and a former a former officer with the department, said in a news conference Thursday. Perez is a plaintiff in the lawsuit alongside about a dozen officers. They are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland and the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. Prince George’s County Circuit Court Judge Maureen Lamasney and state Del. Alonzo T. Washington (D-Prince George’s) were asked to lead the county’s task force and present a report to Alsobrooks by Oct. 30. Washington said the task force will review and consider the recommendations from all community members who submit ideas ahead of the October deadline. The task force had a public listening session scheduled for Thursday evening. The police associations submitted their recommendations in a 10-page letter signed by Perez and UBPOA President Thomas Boone, who is a lieutenant in the department and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The letter calls for the department to eliminate what they call a culture of retaliation against officers who “object to racist statements, racist conduct, and discrimination by white officers.” It also calls for the department to adopt an officer-bystander intervention program that encourages members of the department to step in if they witness wrongdoing by a colleague. “You have to earn respect within your community, and the way you earn respect is showing them you will be a part of the community. . . . You build a police force that wants to learn from their mistakes,” Lt. Sonya Zollicoffer, second vice president of the UBPOA, said in the news conference. “You have to fix within before you can fix outside the department.” The department has said in the past that it works with the Prince George’s County state’s attorney’s office to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, including some ­cases in which officers report other police officers. The associations also urged the department to overhaul how it monitors civilian complaints to look for instances or patterns of racial profiling. Two full sections of the letter include recommendations to address implicit bias in internal-affairs investigations or disciplinary decisions, along with suggestions on revamping the process for filing equal-employment complaints. The final recommendation suggests creating a chief compliance officer ranked higher than the deputy chiefs to head a new “Office of Compliance.” That position’s sole responsibility, the groups said, should be to implement reform recommendations.

police lawsuit,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/settlement-offered-to-latino-ann-arbor-police-officer-to-drop-federal-discrimination-lawsuit/ar-BB1740fW,Settlement offered to Latino Ann Arbor Police officer to drop federal discrimination lawsuit,"ANN ARBOR, MI – A federal discrimination lawsuit filed by a Latino Ann Arbor Police officer two years ago could end soon after a vote passed at Monday’s City Council meeting. The Ann Arbor City Council voted 10-1 July 20 to approve a settlement offer to Ann Arbor Police Sgt. Mauro Cervantes who filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the city and the department in late 2018. Cervantes, an officer in the department for 32 years, filed a federal lawsuit Dec. 14, 2018, accusing the department of ethnic discrimination and disability discrimination for not accommodating a sleep disorder. The lawsuit claims the department retaliated against the sergeant by promoting white officers ahead of him despite his superior performance and test results. The city council approved an offer of $8,500 and a credit of 104 hours compensatory time for Cervantes, contingent with him dropping the lawsuit and the court dismissing all claims with prejudice. Ahead of the vote, City Attorney Stephen Postema advised council members passing the resolution was “a minimal settlement to end federal litigation.” Jeff Hayner, D-1st Ward, cast the only dissenting vote against the offer, stating he was morally opposed to voting for it. “I’m certain that it’s the right thing to do to pass this on, but I’m morally opposed to voting for it, so I’m voting no,” he said during Monday’s meeting. It is unclear if the offer has been accepted as Cervantes’ attorney, Leonard Mungo, could not be reached for comment. Cervantes, in his lawsuit, claims he asked his superiors several times for alternate shift times to accommodate his sleep disorder, but each request was denied. Despite finishing first and second in lieutenant promotion tests in 2016 and 2017, respectively, Cervantes was passed up for promotion by four white sergeants, according to the lawsuit. He noted that none of the people promoted ahead of him suffered from a disability, and that he was unfairly punished for his condition. Cervantes was “qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation,” the court complaint states. The case remains open, but no future court dates are listed. Former small business owner challenges incumbent for Ann Arbor’s state rep. seat ©2020 MLive.com, Walker, Mich.

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill) Connecticut House Majority Leader Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, second from left, stands with fellow Democrats in the House, as they stand for the Pledge of Allegiance during the start of a special session at the State Capitol, Thursday, July 23, 2020, in Hartford, Conn. (AP Photo/Jessica Hill) HARTFORD — Rogue law enforcement officers could become more exposed to lawsuits under a sweeping police accountability bill that passed the House during the morning rush hour Friday after a seven-and-a-half-hour debate, and now heads to the Senate for action next week. The final 86-58 vote, coming just past 9 a.m. after an all-night session, belied a fracture in the majority Democratic caucus that was almost exploited by Republicans, who came within one vote of eliminating the most controversial part of the bill. Republicans tried to strip away the immunity provision, which could increase personal lawsuits against police officers who violate allowable practices. A 72-72 deadlock on the Republican amendment was declared by Speaker of the House Joe Aresimowicz after the House tally machine was kept open for 45 minutes, as both sides scrambled for support from lawmakers. That was not as easy as in normal times. Because of coronavirus protections, most lawmakers remained in their private offices in the state Capitol and nearby Legislative Office Building throughout the debate. Seventeen Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the deletion of the so-called qualified immunity section, which police, Republicans and municipal officials claimed would discourage cops and cost cities and towns even more in annual insurance payments. Even Gov. Ned Lamont had said the section would be better off removed and discussed either later this year or during the next General Assembly session — if the dispute over immunity would derail the whole reform. On Friday morning he expressed support for the final bill. “It’s, I think, a very thoughtful, important piece of legislation that seizes the moment following George Floyd in particular, what it says about transparency, what it says about accountability,” Lamont said. “I didn’t want to have one item necessarily derail that bill and I think the legislature came to a good decision.” The package will likely have an equally tough time in the state Senate, where Democrats hold a 22-14 majority, but where a tie can be broken by Democratic Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz. In the House, Republican, Rep. Jesse MacLachlan of Westbrook voted with Democrats to keep the section, which was approved at about 7 a.m. Heading into the vote on the amendment, an emotional House Majority Leader Matt Ritter said that although his job is to count heads, he didn’t know how much support there was to retain the immunity provision. “I failed in my job today,” he said. “There is no predetermined outcome here. Sometimes democracy can be a little uncomfortable. It can be a little messy. In this country it certainly has not been a perfect process.” Ritter said significant change in the country has come after major expressions of public sentiment, such as the millions of people who have marched nationwide in the two months following the choking death of Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. He said the immunity section mirrors a federal law that allows plaintiffs to seek damages from police who have engaged in wanton conduct. “There’s no new liability standard for an individual officer at all,” Ritter said. “It was the towns that got worried. Folks, towns indemnify everybody now, not just police officers. They indemnify the animal control officers, they indemnify the board of education. That is all already done. That’s why there are huge insurance policies for towns.” Democrats who voted against the provision included Rep. Jonathan Steinberg of Westport, Rep. Stephen Meskers of Greenwich, Rep. Kara Rochelle of Ansonia and Rep. Michelle Cook of Torrington. Two liberal lawmakers who voted on other bills Thursday, Rep. Josh Elliot of Hamden and Rep. Chris Perone of Norwalk, missed the 7 a.m. vote. All day Thursday, legislative leaders attempted to salvage the bill in closed-door negotiations during a historic return to a near-empty state Capitol, from which the public was prohibited entry and lawmakers were encouraged to vote from their offices. Then, at 1:20 a.m., Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, finally introduced the bill — 15 hours after hundreds of off-duty unionized police officers demonstrated against it. “We understood and heard concerns and have tried to strike the right balance on that issue in the current plan before us,” said Stafstrom, stressing a variety of reforms in the proposal, including a new inspector general in charge of investigating and prosecuting the excess use of force. The bill has a new procedure in which officers may lose their certification, ending the tactic of being fired from one department, then finding a police job elsewhere in a statewide revolving door. The bill also would mandate mental health and substance-abuse screening. “We’ve made sure that officers who need behavioral health treatment can get it,” Stafstrom said. “I understand the gravity of this moment we’re in and the debate that’s likely to ensue on this very important issue.” Stafstrom and Rep. Rosa Rebimbas, R-Naugatuck, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, then went back and forth in an hourslong question-and-answer exchange over details of the bill. After 3:30 a.m., Rebimbas raised her voice over the cost of the bill to towns facing the new state mandates. Under questioning by Rebimbas about police searches, Stafstrom defended the bill as “going right to the heart of racial justice.” Rebimbas reviewed the entire bill with Stafstrom. “I stand here with many others acknowledging and knowing that some of these most horrific events have taken place,” she said, conceding instances of police brutality throughout the nation and within Connecticut. She said after the recent virtual public hearing on the bill, GOP lawmakers decided they would oppose the bill. “We met, we discussed and unfortunately there was a time where we had to part ways and we were unable to reach agreement even though we made all attempts to do so,” Rebimbas said, thanking Lamont’s office for participating in negotiations. “Despite all good efforts we have not reached a bipartisan proposal. Maybe it went too far and quite frankly there are still a lot of questions.” After 4 a.m., the 61-person Republican minority, which was down by five members who were not in attendance, submitted the amendment to remove the most provocative section of the bill, which would allow police officers to be personally liable in civil suits by people injured in “malicious, wanton, willful” acts of police brutality, similar to existing federal law. House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby, predicted that it would result in higher costs for towns and the need for personal liability insurance for law enforcement officers. “Unfortunately, this became an issue of taking sides. The problem is clear,” Klarides said of the reforms that brought out a sharp divided between Democrats and Republicans. “The solution is unclear.” Ritter disagreed. “No one needs insurance policies, because it’s the same legal standard” as the federal rules, he said during the majority leader’s traditional summation. “You know it has good stuff in it,” he said asking for bipartisan support after the immunity clause was aired and the attempt to overturn the section was defeated by the slimmest of margins. Early in the debate, when Democratic leaders were unsure whether the bill would pass, GOP leaders said they did not plan to draft such an amendment and lawmakers on both sides wondered whether Democrats opposed to the section would offer their own attempt to remove the immunity piece. Black and Latino members of the House rose up with emotion, memories and first-hand experience against the effort to delete the section. “This is about listening to your colleagues,” said Rep. Quentin Phipps, D-Middletown, shortly after 6:20 a.m., citing the 40 or so people killed by police in Connecticut over the last five years. “This is about starting to hold folks accountable,” said the Black lawmaker. “We have normalized our trauma.” Rep. Roland Lemar, D-New Haven, who is white, agreed that after centuries of history “400 years of excuses and some 60 years of qualified immunity,” it is “a ridiculous standard” that has been used by police who have killed young teens, arrested people outside their homes and who regularly profile people of color. “It is a ridiculous standard that I would doubt anyone would vote for,” Lemar said. “Can we protect our citizens just a little bit more than the federal government? This is an egregious legal standard that needs to be removed. Deny this amendment.” “We can easily call this the ostrich amendment, where we just stick our heads in the sand,” said Rep. Edwin Vargas, a retired school teacher from Hartford. “This could be like a breath of fresh air.” The bill came under fire on Thursday morning as about 300 off-duty police officers and supporters — many without face masks to fight COVID-19 — led by Andrew Matthews, executive director of the Connecticut State Police Union, chanted “Vote Them Out” near an entrance to the Capitol, which has been closed to the public since March 12 in the coronavirus pandemic. Sgt. John Castiline, president of the Connecticut State Police Union, charged that only “brain dead” lawmakers or “cop haters” would vote for the bill, predicted that if the immunity portion of the bill were to pass, mass resignations and retirements would result statewide across all law enforcement agencies. This show of muscle may have cast further doubt in lawmakers facing reelection this year. The immunity section was also opposed by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and the Council of Small Towns. Other protesters under the Black Lives Matter banner, outnumbered by police, rallied in favor of the accountability measures at the Capitol Thursday. An earlier version of this story attributed the remarks criticizing lawmakers to Andrew Matthews, but they were said by Sgt. John Castiline, president of the State Police Union. kdixon@ctpost.com Twitter: @KenDixonCT"
police lawsuit,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/24/tony-mcdade-judge-rules-marsys-law-does-not-apply-cop/5502698002/,"Florida police officer on duty in Tony McDade's shooting death must be identified, judge rules","TALLAHASSEE – A Leon Circuit judge ruled today that the Tallahassee police officer who shot and killed Tony McDade is not protected under Marsy’s Law, clearing the way for release of his name. Judge Charles Dodson found that Marsy’s Law, a constitutional amendment passed by Florida voters in 2018, doesn’t apply in the high-profile use-of-force case. Marsy's Law granted crime victims the right to prevent disclosure of information that could be used to ""locate or harass"" them and their families. The order could well set the first controlling legal precedent on limitations to Florida's crime victim bill of rights and its application in police use-of-force cases. “The court finds that the explicit language of Marsy's Law was not intended to apply to law enforcement officers when acting in their official capacity,” Dodson wrote. The judge, in a brisk five-page order, added that law enforcement officers have ""a unique duty"" to enforce the laws of the state but are not shielded by Marsy's Law. ""Theirs is a very difficult and important job,"" Dodson wrote. ""The public has a vital right to evaluate the conduct of our law enforcement officers, who are empowered to arrest people and use deadly force. For this court to hold that on-duty law enforcement officers may use Marsy's Law to prevent the disclosure of their names would provide them with a protection not intended by the express purpose of that law."" First Amendment advocates hailed the decision as major legal victory. “Today’s ruling was a win for public oversight and police accountability,"" said Mark Caramanica, an attorney for news outlets, including the Tallahassee Democrat and USA TODAY NETWORK that intervened in the case. ""The court correctly found that Marsy’s Law is not a vehicle to hide police action from the public.” The Florida Police Benevolent Association, which sued the city to block release of the officers' names, immediately filed notice of its intent to appeal. The move likely means the officers' names won't be released for now. Stephen Webster, an attorney for the PBA, said he appreciated the ""careful attention"" Dodson gave the lawsuit. ""I respect the job that he does always,"" Webster said. ""We obviously disagree. We filed notice of appeal. And the officers are entitled to an automatic stay of the ruling pending review by the 1st District Court of Appeal.” McDade, 38, a Black transgender man, was killed May 27, just minutes after stabbing a next-door neighbor to death on Saxon Street and fleeing to apartments on nearby Holton Street. An arriving officer used deadly force after McDade pointed a gun at him, police officials have said. Another officer also was on scene during the shooting. The PBA filed its lawsuit last month to shield the officers from public release of their names. Attorneys for the police union argued that the officers were victims of aggravated assault and thus protected under Marsy’s Law. The city and a consortium of news outlets and organizations argued otherwise, saying police officers carrying out their official duties should not be granted confidentiality. Attorneys for the media said ruling otherwise would prevent the public from holding police accountable. The PBA also argued that releasing the officers' names could jeopardize their lives. In its complaint, the PBA said people at the scene threatened the officer who shot McDade and that there has been ""ongoing animosity"" against him since. ""His fear for his safety is reasonable, especially given the current unrest that has followed in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis,"" the police union wrote in its lawsuit. Advocates for Marsy’s Law for Florida emailed the Democrat Monday saying that the amendment should shield the name of officers unless a determination of wrongdoing is made. “Police officers who have become victims of crime deserve the same constitutional rights as everyone else,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Fennell. ""But police officers who have committed crimes cannot hide behind Marsy’s Law."" ""If a determination is made that a police officer has broken the law in the case, they become a defendant in that case and as such they automatically lose all their rights as a victim under the Marsy’s Law provision of the Florida Constitution and their name must be released,"" Fennell continued. But Dodson rejected that argument. He noted that while the PBA and others seek to treat the officers as victims, the people who would have been accused are dead, ""killed by the officers in the line of duty."" ""The officers ... apparently seek protection from possible retribution for their on-duty actions from unknown persons in the community,"" Dodson wrote. ""This type of protection is outside the scope of Marsy's Law and is inconsistent with the express purpose and language of the amendment. This court cannot interpret Marsy's Law to shield police officers from public scrutiny of their official actions."""
police lawsuit,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/07/24/rubber-bullets-less-lethal-weapons-victims-police-protesters-decades/5410519002/,"Police use of rubber bullets, bean bag rounds has left a bloody trail for decades. Those maimed say enough is enough.","There’s a gap in Scott Olsen’s memory for the night of Oct. 25, 2011. The Iraq War vet remembers leaving his tech job in the San Francisco Bay Area and taking a BART train to join an Occupy Oakland protest against economic and social inequality. He remembers standing near protesters who faced off with Oakland police officers bristling with riot gear. He remembers being carried away by other protesters. But not the moment when a “bean bag” round fired from an officer’s 12-gauge shotgun crashed into the left side of his head, fracturing his skull and inflicting a near-fatal brain injury that forced him to relearn how to talk. What happened to Olsen was not unique or isolated. Time and again over the past two decades – from L.A. to D.C., Minneapolis to Miami – peace officers have targeted civilian demonstrators with munitions designed to stun and stop, rather than kill. As many as 60 protesters suffered head wounds during Black Lives Matter events, including bone fractures, blindness and traumatic brain injuries. Activists and civil libertarians worldwide have urged police to ban less lethal projectiles from use for crowd control. Law enforcement in the United Kingdom ceased using them that way decades ago. But an investigation by USA TODAY and Kaiser Health News found little has changed over the years in the United States. Beyond the Constitution and federal court rulings that require police use of force to be “reasonable,” there are no national rules for discharging bean bags and rubber bullets. Nor are there standards for the weapons’ velocity, accuracy or safety. Congress and state legislatures have done little to offer solutions. While locations and demonstration types vary, a pattern has emerged: Shooting victims file lawsuits; cities pay out millions of dollars; police departments try to adopt reforms. And, a few years later, it happens again. Law enforcement officers, typically with limited training, are bound only by departmental policies that vary from one agency to the next. Sometimes referred to as kinetic impact projectiles, less lethal ammunition includes bean bags (nylon sacks filled with lead shot), so-called rubber bullets that actually are tipped with foam or sponge and paintball-like rounds containing chemical irritants. Velocity and range vary greatly, but they can travel upwards of 200 mph. The rounds were developed to save lives by giving police a knock-down option that can disable threats from a safe distance without killing the target. The past two months have been especially telling, with dozens maimed or hurt amid Black Lives Matter demonstrations: Photographer Linda Tirado, 37, lost an eye after being hit by a foam projectile in Minneapolis. Brandon Saenz, 26, lost an eye and several teeth after being hit with a “sponge round” in Dallas. Leslie Furcron, 59, was placed in a medically induced coma after she was shot between the eyes with a “bean bag” round in La Mesa, California. And, in Portland, Oregon, 26-year-old Donavan La Bella suffered facial and skull fractures when he was shot by a federal officer with a less lethal round. “Nothing has changed,” said attorney Elizabeth Ritter, 59, one of several people shot in the head by an impact munition at a 2003 protest in Miami. A video later surfaced showing police supervisors laughing about her shooting. “It’s fairly sickening to me. We have a systemic, deeply ingrained problem.” From a law enforcement perspective, less lethal weapons are essential tools in a continuum of force.  A sponge-tipped round or a pouch full of pellets can stop a violent act without putting the officer in peril – and without killing the suspect. Police leaders typically condemn the indiscriminate firing into peaceful crowds but characterize such incidents as conduct violations rather than weaponry problems. Steve Ijames, a retired officer who developed programs for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, blames “boneheaded policemen’’ and a training gap for the misuse of arms. Law enforcement instruction focuses almost entirely on how to use less lethal force against individual suspects, Ijames noted, and not on crowd-control scenarios that occur only sporadically. Still, when demonstrations morph into disturbances, less lethal devices are often dusted off and pressed into duty. “What is the alternative?” asked Sid Heal, a retired commander from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department who has extensively studied the munitions. “We’re stuck with the tools we have. And if you take one away, we’re going to have to go to something else, and it will probably be harsher.” The National Institute of Justice spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on initiatives to collect data and start developing national standards for less lethal weapon safety after the Boston student’s death in 2004. Funding dried up after a few years, and the efforts died. Against that backdrop, Congress has shown little interest in regulating bean bags and rubber bullets. And national law enforcement leadership groups have repeatedly punted when given an opportunity. After the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2014, 2015 and 2017 would have banned state and local law enforcement from using key federal grant dollars for less lethal weapons. The measure never made it out of committee. In 2017, a coalition of law enforcement groups representing police leaders and unions, which gathered to study use of force, published a consensus policy and discussion paper. The groups advocated a ban on police use of martial arts weapons – but did not extend it to less lethal munitions. A White House task force established after the Ferguson protests recommended “annual training” but little more for less lethal weapons. In June, 13 U.S. Senate Democrats asked the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to investigate the alleged misuses of rubber bullets and bean bags against Black Lives Matter demonstrations. “Although intended to only cause minimal harm, such weapons may cause significant injury,” the senators wrote. “Better information is needed to identify deficiencies in the training and use of these less lethal weapons ...” The Justice Department’s inspector general has launched an investigation of federal officers’ response to protest activity in Portland and Washington, D.C., the watchdog announced Thursday. Leaders of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Oversight committees this month had asked the office to review federal officers’ “violent tactics” used against protesters in those cities and elsewhere. And in California, several Democrat legislators introduced a measure in June that would ban the police use of less lethal munitions to disperse demonstrators. Except in riot conditions, the proposed law says, kinetic energy projectiles “shall not be used by any law enforcement agency against an assembly protected by the First Amendment.” Charles Mesloh, a former police officer, certified instructor and longtime researcher on less lethal weapons, said the status quo is “unacceptable,” but he sees little chance that national standards will be imposed for training, weapon safety and use. “I’ve been doing this long enough, I just – we’re just in a circle,” Mesloh said. “We’ll have some lip service ... and there'll be some mandated training, and then we’ll just go right back to where we were.” Carol Sobel, a Los Angeles civil rights attorney, keeps an unusual photo on her desk. It shows her with a goose-egg wound to her forehead and two black eyes. What’s not visible in the picture is the concussion, sinus fracture and more than six months of headaches. That’s the impact of a police projectile that struck her between the eyes as she stood outside the 2000 Democratic National Convention with a mainly peaceful crowd. ""My head snapped back and it hurt,"" she said. ""It was inconceivable to me that someone would shoot me in the face."" Over the past two decades, Los Angeles police have repeatedly used less lethal firepower on demonstrators, injuring hundreds and generating lawsuits that Sobel helped prosecute. Los Angeles police turned to bean bags as an alternative to live ammo after 1992 rioting triggered by the acquittal of officers who beat a Black man named Rodney King. As violence swept the city, police at first hunkered down, doing little to maintain order, then launched an aggressive crackdown. Ten people were killed by officers. In the aftermath, the department was criticized simultaneously for brutality and for failure to defend the community. Bean bag rounds and later 40mm projectiles emerged as options that were supposed to allow officers to protect themselves and the city without deaths or lawsuits. With the new arsenal, police in 2000 descended on protesters at MacArthur Park during the convention. Witnesses said demonstrators were shot in the back with rubber bullets as they tried to disperse. The city approved $4.1 million in payments to more than 90 people hurt during the melee. Among the shooting victims was Melissa Schneider, who secured a $1.4 million settlement after being blinded in one eye. Two decades later, Schneider said she still wakes up with excruciating pain where the eye used to be and frequently vomits as a result of migraines. Schneider said she was shaken watching internet videos of protesters injured in recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations:  “I immediately started sobbing – not for me, but for them and the journey they had ahead,” she said. “Things need to change. And it’s really sad. It’s been 20 years, and this is still happening.” Seven years after Schneider was maimed, Los Angeles police were back in MacArthur Park using batons, horses and less lethal rounds during a protest for immigrants' rights. More than 250 people were injured. An internal review determined projectiles were launched into crowds and at peaceful protesters. Although such weapons are supposed to be used to stop lawbreakers, no demonstrator was arrested. This time, city taxpayers forked out $13 million to settle civil complaints. The Police Department agreed to four years of court supervision, with rules banning the use of less lethal rounds against peaceful protesters. By 2015, amid a national controversy over police killings, Los Angeles police leaders were touting less lethal weapons as part of a kinder, gentler approach. The agency in 2017 adopted a progressive policy requiring officers to try de-escalation tactics before opening fire. But in May, when protests erupted after the death of George Floyd, police in Los Angeles unleashed bean bags and sponge rounds. A lawsuit filed by Black Lives Matter alleges “that the training of the LAPD in the use of these potentially lethal weapons was absent, seriously deficient, or intentionally indifferent to the known serious harm that can result.” The complaint, with Sobel as lead attorney, seeks an emergency ban on the use of less lethal arms for crowd control. Lawyers for the city argued a blanket ban would hamstring efforts to maintain law and order. Los Angeles police leaders declined to be interviewed for this article because it deals with personnel matters and issues that “will eventually be fleshed out in a complete, independent after-action report.” Sobel said she has seen it all before: “There is absolutely no institutional memory in the LAPD. That's No. 1. And No. 2 – they don't care."" Victoria Snelgrove leaned against a railing of a parking garage at Fenway Park, waiting for the crowd to dissipate so she could drive home from a raucous Red Sox celebration. Then Boston police fired the projectile that tore through her eye and into her brain. The home team had just defeated the New York Yankees to win the 2004 American League Championship. Sox fans rejoiced in the streets around the stadium. After some set fires and threw bottles, police began launching projectiles. Snelgrove, a 21-year-old college student and sports enthusiast who aspired to be an entertainment reporter on television, slipped into a coma. Her parents made the excruciating decision to remove life support hours later. The family collected $5 million in damages – reportedly the city’s largest settlement in history at the time. Snelgrove’s death spurred Boston police to convene a panel to figure out what went wrong. Among the commission findings: Boston had acquired its launchers less than a year earlier, without adequate understanding of safety issues. The manufacturer had suggested rounds would not break the skin. But a second protester had had a projectile lodged in his forehead, and a third suffered a gaping wound to the cheek. The commission said police needed more training on how to use less lethal weapons, particularly in crowd-control situations. It called for the National Institute of Justice to collect and disseminate comprehensive information on a burgeoning array of less lethal projectiles. And it urged the federal government to develop minimum safety standards with a testing program overseen by an independent agency such as the institute. Those recommendations were championed by Sen. Ted Kennedy, who said, ""The growing use and the false sense that they are completely safe are leading to the kind of avoidable tragedy that shocked all of us in Boston."" NIJ awarded grants to a Wayne State University researcher, Cynthia Bir, to help develop standards. Over several years, study groups were formed. Testing modes were developed. Then, according to Bir, Tasers and other equipment became more widely used by police. As interest in rubber bullets and bean bags waned, the Great Recession depleted funding. Research efforts dissolved along with prospects for standards for less lethal weapons. “NIJ gave us a fair amount of funding to look at this issue and then … the focus switched to Tasers,” Bir said. “Everything just kind of went away.” The NIJ did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment. Rick Wyant, a forensic scientist who served on an NIJ panel, said standards could be imposed by tying them to federal law enforcement grants. Otherwise, unregulated arms can continue putting the public at risk, he said. “I can go in my garage and develop something, and if I get a (police) chief to sign off on it and deploy it, that’s all that needs to happen,” Wyant said. U.S. law enforcement and defense agencies spend about $2.5 billion annually on less lethal weapons and ammunition, according to Anuj Mishra, an analyst with MarketsandMarkets, a research firm based in India. That's almost half the global total and includes sales of tear gas and Tasers as well as projectile weapons. Mishra said less lethal weapons sales have taken off with a proliferation of new products. More than a half-dozen companies supply U.S. police departments with plastic and rubber bullets, paintball-type rounds, launchers and less lethal projectiles fired from 12-gauge shotguns. Sales are driven by personal relationships, Internet advertising and trade shows where police try out the latest models on shooting ranges, industry executives say. “Cops are always looking for gadgets. They’re always looking for new technology,” said Eugene Paoline, professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida. “They like toys.” Less lethal weapons became part of a national conversation after the deadly 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager, in Ferguson, Missouri. As police agencies responded to protests with military-style tactics, criticism mounted from  medical, civil rights and activist groups that condemn the use of less lethal projectiles to break up demonstrations. Physicians for Human Rights, for example, contends that kinetic-impact bullets “are not an appropriate weapon to be used for crowd management, and specifically for dispersal purposes.” Rohini Haar, an emergency room physician and researcher at the University of California Berkeley, co-authored research in 2017 with Physicians for Human Rights on the damage inflicted by less lethal rounds. In a study of nearly 2,000 shooting victims, 3% died and 15% were permanently disabled. Haar’s takeaway: “Policing has to have a reckoning,” and that would include a ban on rubber bullets and more regulation of all less lethal weapons in crowd-control scenarios. By contrast, police and government inquiries after the Ferguson protests resulted in no clear guidelines for the use of plastic and bean bag rounds.  A task force created by President Obama, which urged federal investigations of inappropriate use of police equipment and tactics during demonstrations, recommended little more than “annual training.” Eleven of the nation’s top law enforcement leadership organizations in 2017 developed what they called a National Consensus Policy on Use of Force. The white paper lacks detailed direction for less lethal munitions while stressing that even vague guidance is “not intended to be a national standard by which all agencies are held accountable.” In the aftermath of George Floyd demonstrations, that report was updated earlier this month. But wording on less lethal weaponry remained the same: It urges police to ban martial arts weapons such as blackjacks and nunchucks, but avoids a recommendation on less lethal projectiles, leaving decisions to individual agencies. Terrence Cunningham, who took part in the review as president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said after inquiries for this story that he now supports a consensus policy for less lethal munitions. “We definitely need some kind of foundational standards,” said Cunningham, now the association’s deputy executive director. Meanwhile, the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit think tank, last year convened 225 police chiefs, officers, industry representatives and academics for yet another symposium on police use of force. The forum's 45-page report endorses less lethal arms as a sometimes controversial part of the law enforcement toolkit and emphasizes that the weapons ""often do not work as desired."" Law enforcement experts point out there are about 18,000 police forces in the United States, and it may be impossible to develop homogeneous standards or practices that work in communities ranging from New York City to Minooka, Illinois. “Most agencies in America are 50 people or less. They don’t have big budgets,” said Don Kester, head of training for the National Tactical Officer Association. “You write a (detailed) policy and all the chiefs say you’ve created an unfunded mandate” for equipment and training. The alternative – and the reality – is a system where each agency decides which weapons to use, what training to provide, and what policies to enforce. All operate on the same underlying function, as spelled out by Ed Obayashi, an attorney and deputy chief of California’s Plumas County Sheriff’s Office: “to inflict pain to gain compliance and to disperse a crowd.” If protesters ignore police instructions, he added, firing on the overall crowd could be justified depending on circumstances. Obayashi allowed that videos taken during recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations presented “bad optics” for less lethal weapons. But a full story can’t be presented from films, he said while asserting that the overall response by U.S. peace officers was “very controlled and did not cause a measurable number of serious injuries.” “When law enforcement gives an order to disperse, and that doesn’t happen, we don’t have a lot of options,” agreed Wade Carpenter, the police chief in Park City, Utah, who oversees IACP’s firearms and tactical committees. “Whenever we have individuals that are trying to incite these riots, there is a level of force that has to be used.” If Scott Olsen struggles to recall what happened when police shot him with a bean bag round, his sentiments about the Oakland Police Department are crystal clear: “I think bad things,” Olsen, now 33, said in a recent phone interview. The projectile that struck Olsen’s head in 2011 was launched despite previous, similar incidents that resulted in lawsuits, independent investigations, court orders and police reforms. James Chanin, an Oakland attorney who filed some of the civil actions, and won settlements, tells about a “long history of alleged civil rights violations” by the city’s police force. In April 2003, protesters against the Iraq War blocked a Port of Oakland entrance at a marine terminal. A lawsuit described how police moved to break up the demonstration, firing wooden dowels to skip them off the ground at protesters, shooting bean bag rounds into the crowd, and setting off stinger grenades that scattered chemical irritants and small balls. Sri Louise Coles, a lead plaintiff in one of the cases, alleged that she suffered face and neck wounds from a projectile and additional injuries when an officer rammed her with a motorcycle. In settling that case, Oakland agreed to new crowd-control and management policies. Less lethal munitions “shall not be used for crowd management, crowd control or crowd dispersal,” the policy instructed, and such devices “may never be used indiscriminately against a crowd or group of persons.” Eight years later, Olsen was near the front of an Occupy Oakland demonstration when police declared the gathering an illegal assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse. Officers then launched a fusillade of less lethal munitions, including the round that struck Olsen. As other protesters rushed to his aid, an Oakland police officer deployed a chemical canister into the group, an independent investigation commissioned by the city later found. Police said afterward that they did not see Olsen had been wounded, so they did not fulfill a mandatory requirement to render medical aid and immediately start a formal investigation of the shooting. The independent investigation called the police department's account “unsettling and not believable.” The investigation also said the decision to use less lethal munitions “may or may not have been reasonable” based on the police department’s existing policy at the time. “We recommend that further research should be conducted to identify and evaluate other munitions that are less prone to cause injuries, but are still effective as crowd control devices,” the investigators concluded. The final report compared the city’s crowd-control effort to an aviation disaster caused not by a single mistake, but by “a series of cascading events.” In Oakland’s case, the tragedy stemmed in part from  years of “diminishing resources,” and “increasing workload.” The city ultimately agreed to a $4.5 million settlement with Olsen. Once again, Oakland revised policies and training. For several years, Chanin said, the cycle of protests, shootings and lawsuits seemed to stop. Then George Floyd demonstrations broke out, and so did the less lethal weapons. According to a federal complaint filed in June by the Anti Police-Terror Project, Oakland officers indiscriminately launched projectiles, flashbangs and tear gas into crowds and at individuals. Attorneys for both sides in the case stipulated to an agreement that forbids Oakland police from using less lethal weapons against demonstrators. For Olsen, now tending bee colonies and chickens on a small Wisconsin farm, the memory with a hole came flooding back. “We passed these regulations and policies to control the use of less lethal weapons,” he said. “It’s heartbreaking to see other people’s lives affected as mine was. … Police have shown they do not care about these kinds of controls, so the next step is to take those weapons away from them.” Graphics: Javier Zarracina and Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY.

police lawsuit,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/boston-public-schools-boston-police-department-face-more-lawsuits-seeking-student-records-that-immigration-agents-could-access/ar-BB176QNO,"Boston Public Schools, Boston Police Department face more lawsuits seeking student records that immigration agents could access","Advocacy groups are suing the Boston Police Department and Boston Public Schools to make them disclose what student information they have shared with federal immigration authorities. The Center for Law and Education, Inc., the Multicultural Education, Training, and Advocacy, Inc. and Lawyers for Civil Rights filed two companion lawsuits in Suffolk Superior Court Thursday, one against the police department and another against the school district. The coalition of organizations submitted public records requests in early February seeking copies of incident reports, intelligence reports and other records sent by the school district to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or to the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, a gang database that has made information available about schoolchildren suspected of gang affiliation. They sought six years forth of records. The complaint argues both entities failed to fulfill public records requests months after they’re required to under state law. Boston Public Schools Superintendent Brenda Cassellius is also named in the lawsuit. “We want transparency. This is vital, especially given the urgent conversations around BPS’ Student Privacy Policy,” Janelle Dempsey, an attorney at Lawyers for Civil Rights, said in a statement. “The Cassellius administration has an opportunity here to solidify its commitment to addressing the deeply-rooted systemic racial issues the Superintendent inherited when she took office last year.” The latest lawsuits accompany an original legal battle between Lawyers for Civil Rights and the school district. Through that lawsuit, Boston Public Schools turned over 135 incident reports that the district shared with the BRIC. Advocates say school attorneys instructed them to submit a new public records request after saying only the police department had custody of certain records. “The public has a right to know the extent to which schools are sharing information of school children via the BRIC, particularly in this new era of national heightened public scrutiny of police, with urgent calls for accountability to the public which they serve,” said Kathleen Boundy, co-director of the Center for Law and Education. The last response from the city came from Shawn A. Williams, director of public records, on April 30, saying he was reviewing the outstanding requests for records and “hopes to get as many resolved as possible.” The department has multiple outstanding public records requests regarding the BRIC, including one from MassLive. The role of the database came under scrutiny after an East Boston High School student named Orlando was detained by ICE agents following a lunchroom fight. Accused of being an MS-13 member, Orlando was deported to El Salvador in 2017. Sarah Sherman-Stokes, who represented Orlando, told MassLive that Orlando had no gang ties and entered the United Stares in 2014 to join his father. In the complaint filed Thursday, advocates argue the delay of the public records is not only illegal, but it prevents the public from understanding how student information ends up in the hands of federal immigration agents. “It is critical that the students’ rights groups receive the public records requested in a timely fashion as funding of BRIC and the BPS policy relating to the sharing of student information are both under review,” the complaint states. “Absent this information, the students’ rights groups and the public at large lack the ability to participate in the discussion of these issues in any meaningful way.” Massachusetts lawmakers are debating police reform bills that would limit what information school employees and school resource officers can share. The House and Senate bills, including the provisions limiting student data sharing, have sparked criticism from law enforcement officials, their loved ones and other opponents. In testimony submitted to lawmakers last week, several submitted letters stating the bill was packed with hidden provisions “to protect drug dealers, human traffickers, gang activity in minority neighborhood schools, organized retail theft and terrorists.” ©2020 MassLive.com, Springfield, Mass.

police settlement,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/settlement-offered-to-latino-ann-arbor-police-officer-to-drop-federal-discrimination-lawsuit/ar-BB1740fW,Settlement offered to Latino Ann Arbor Police officer to drop federal discrimination lawsuit,"ANN ARBOR, MI – A federal discrimination lawsuit filed by a Latino Ann Arbor Police officer two years ago could end soon after a vote passed at Monday’s City Council meeting. The Ann Arbor City Council voted 10-1 July 20 to approve a settlement offer to Ann Arbor Police Sgt. Mauro Cervantes who filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the city and the department in late 2018. Cervantes, an officer in the department for 32 years, filed a federal lawsuit Dec. 14, 2018, accusing the department of ethnic discrimination and disability discrimination for not accommodating a sleep disorder. The lawsuit claims the department retaliated against the sergeant by promoting white officers ahead of him despite his superior performance and test results. The city council approved an offer of $8,500 and a credit of 104 hours compensatory time for Cervantes, contingent with him dropping the lawsuit and the court dismissing all claims with prejudice. Ahead of the vote, City Attorney Stephen Postema advised council members passing the resolution was “a minimal settlement to end federal litigation.” Jeff Hayner, D-1st Ward, cast the only dissenting vote against the offer, stating he was morally opposed to voting for it. “I’m certain that it’s the right thing to do to pass this on, but I’m morally opposed to voting for it, so I’m voting no,” he said during Monday’s meeting. It is unclear if the offer has been accepted as Cervantes’ attorney, Leonard Mungo, could not be reached for comment. Cervantes, in his lawsuit, claims he asked his superiors several times for alternate shift times to accommodate his sleep disorder, but each request was denied. Despite finishing first and second in lieutenant promotion tests in 2016 and 2017, respectively, Cervantes was passed up for promotion by four white sergeants, according to the lawsuit. He noted that none of the people promoted ahead of him suffered from a disability, and that he was unfairly punished for his condition. Cervantes was “qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation,” the court complaint states. The case remains open, but no future court dates are listed. Former small business owner challenges incumbent for Ann Arbor’s state rep. seat ©2020 MLive.com, Walker, Mich.

police settlement,https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-police-misconduct-settlements-raja-krishnamoorthi-20200720-f63im4kx2rcpjfqt6y4wtnlkqy-story.html,Commentary: Let taxpayers know where money for police misconduct settlements comes from,"When we pay our taxes, we expect that hard-earned money to go for essential services such as schools, roads, protection and public safety. We neither expect nor want millions of dollars each year to go toward police misconduct. It’s time to shine a light on how much those legal settlements are costing taxpayers — and how they are being financed. First, let’s make clear that the vast majority of police officers are doing their difficult jobs well. An investigation by USA Today found that 90% of officers are never subject to misconduct complaints. But of the 10% of officers who were investigated for misconduct, most had faced 10 or more charges and some faced more than 100. The cost of their misconduct was enormous in financial terms as well as human ones. According to reporting by ABC News, police misconduct lawsuits across the nation cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in 2019 alone. While settlement amounts vary substantially by municipality by year, the city of New York paid out $175.9 million in police misconduct settlements in the 2019 fiscal year. During the same period, the city of Los Angeles paid out $91.5 million. The Chicago Reporter found that in 2018 alone, Chicago taxpayers paid out $113 million in police misconduct settlements and associated legal fees. According to the Chicago Tribune, these settlements involved cases running the gamut from a grandmother’s killing by an officer firing at a teenager carrying a baseball bat to two men killed when their car was struck by an intoxicated off-duty detective. Another incident involved a man who suffered brain damage when officers shot him with a stun gun while he was being treated by paramedics for chest pains. To cover the cost of these settlements, some cities have opted to raise taxes. Others have typically issued bonds. “Police brutality bonds,” as they are known, appeal to cities suffering from revenue shortfalls. But according to a report by the Action Center on Race and the Economy, these bonds fail to address the underlying causes of police misconduct while providing undue profits to Wall Street investors off the pain and suffering of victims and communities. To make matters worse, such bonds also greatly increase the burden on taxpayers as bank fees and interest for investors can nearly double the cost of settlements. But according to Human Rights Watch, “no nationwide, systemic data are kept regarding” these settlements. Moreover, according to a study titled “How Governments Pay: Lawsuits, Budgets, and Police Reform,” “information about the amounts paid in suits involving law enforcement officers is not collected” in many cases. This means it is very difficult, if not impossible, for taxpayers to know how much of their own money is going toward police misconduct settlements, even as some mayors, including Mayor Lori Lightfoot, have prioritized reducing settlement costs and increasing accountability. The Justice in Policing Act, recently passed by the U.S. House, establishes a National Police Misconduct Registry to track misconduct and disciplinary records of officers from across the country. This could prevent those fired for misconduct in one place from being hired in another. It also will track records of lawsuits and settlements made against law enforcement officers. This is real progress, but we need to go further — by requiring the disclosure of how those police misconduct settlements are funded. Taxpayers deserve to know whether those settlements are being paid out of police department funds specifically allocated for this purpose; whether local governments are issuing bonds to cover the debt; whether the settlements are resulting in higher taxes; or whether they’re being paid for through cuts in local programs and services. Establishing transparency around these costs, and how they’re paid, is critical to spurring more reform, encouraging more equitable policing and reducing police misconduct resulting in lower monetary settlements. The savings that would otherwise be spent on settlements could be shifted back into communities and alternative ways to enhance public and community safety. American taxpayers deserve to know where their hard-earned money is going, and transparency regarding this spending is an issue that we should all support.

police settlement,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/07/24/rubber-bullets-less-lethal-weapons-victims-police-protesters-decades/5410519002/,"Police use of rubber bullets, bean bag rounds has left a bloody trail for decades. Those maimed say enough is enough.","There’s a gap in Scott Olsen’s memory for the night of Oct. 25, 2011. The Iraq War vet remembers leaving his tech job in the San Francisco Bay Area and taking a BART train to join an Occupy Oakland protest against economic and social inequality. He remembers standing near protesters who faced off with Oakland police officers bristling with riot gear. He remembers being carried away by other protesters. But not the moment when a “bean bag” round fired from an officer’s 12-gauge shotgun crashed into the left side of his head, fracturing his skull and inflicting a near-fatal brain injury that forced him to relearn how to talk. What happened to Olsen was not unique or isolated. Time and again over the past two decades – from L.A. to D.C., Minneapolis to Miami – peace officers have targeted civilian demonstrators with munitions designed to stun and stop, rather than kill. As many as 60 protesters suffered head wounds during Black Lives Matter events, including bone fractures, blindness and traumatic brain injuries. Activists and civil libertarians worldwide have urged police to ban less lethal projectiles from use for crowd control. Law enforcement in the United Kingdom ceased using them that way decades ago. But an investigation by USA TODAY and Kaiser Health News found little has changed over the years in the United States. Beyond the Constitution and federal court rulings that require police use of force to be “reasonable,” there are no national rules for discharging bean bags and rubber bullets. Nor are there standards for the weapons’ velocity, accuracy or safety. Congress and state legislatures have done little to offer solutions. While locations and demonstration types vary, a pattern has emerged: Shooting victims file lawsuits; cities pay out millions of dollars; police departments try to adopt reforms. And, a few years later, it happens again. Law enforcement officers, typically with limited training, are bound only by departmental policies that vary from one agency to the next. Sometimes referred to as kinetic impact projectiles, less lethal ammunition includes bean bags (nylon sacks filled with lead shot), so-called rubber bullets that actually are tipped with foam or sponge and paintball-like rounds containing chemical irritants. Velocity and range vary greatly, but they can travel upwards of 200 mph. The rounds were developed to save lives by giving police a knock-down option that can disable threats from a safe distance without killing the target. The past two months have been especially telling, with dozens maimed or hurt amid Black Lives Matter demonstrations: Photographer Linda Tirado, 37, lost an eye after being hit by a foam projectile in Minneapolis. Brandon Saenz, 26, lost an eye and several teeth after being hit with a “sponge round” in Dallas. Leslie Furcron, 59, was placed in a medically induced coma after she was shot between the eyes with a “bean bag” round in La Mesa, California. And, in Portland, Oregon, 26-year-old Donavan La Bella suffered facial and skull fractures when he was shot by a federal officer with a less lethal round. “Nothing has changed,” said attorney Elizabeth Ritter, 59, one of several people shot in the head by an impact munition at a 2003 protest in Miami. A video later surfaced showing police supervisors laughing about her shooting. “It’s fairly sickening to me. We have a systemic, deeply ingrained problem.” From a law enforcement perspective, less lethal weapons are essential tools in a continuum of force.  A sponge-tipped round or a pouch full of pellets can stop a violent act without putting the officer in peril – and without killing the suspect. Police leaders typically condemn the indiscriminate firing into peaceful crowds but characterize such incidents as conduct violations rather than weaponry problems. Steve Ijames, a retired officer who developed programs for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, blames “boneheaded policemen’’ and a training gap for the misuse of arms. Law enforcement instruction focuses almost entirely on how to use less lethal force against individual suspects, Ijames noted, and not on crowd-control scenarios that occur only sporadically. Still, when demonstrations morph into disturbances, less lethal devices are often dusted off and pressed into duty. “What is the alternative?” asked Sid Heal, a retired commander from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department who has extensively studied the munitions. “We’re stuck with the tools we have. And if you take one away, we’re going to have to go to something else, and it will probably be harsher.” The National Institute of Justice spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on initiatives to collect data and start developing national standards for less lethal weapon safety after the Boston student’s death in 2004. Funding dried up after a few years, and the efforts died. Against that backdrop, Congress has shown little interest in regulating bean bags and rubber bullets. And national law enforcement leadership groups have repeatedly punted when given an opportunity. After the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2014, 2015 and 2017 would have banned state and local law enforcement from using key federal grant dollars for less lethal weapons. The measure never made it out of committee. In 2017, a coalition of law enforcement groups representing police leaders and unions, which gathered to study use of force, published a consensus policy and discussion paper. The groups advocated a ban on police use of martial arts weapons – but did not extend it to less lethal munitions. A White House task force established after the Ferguson protests recommended “annual training” but little more for less lethal weapons. In June, 13 U.S. Senate Democrats asked the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to investigate the alleged misuses of rubber bullets and bean bags against Black Lives Matter demonstrations. “Although intended to only cause minimal harm, such weapons may cause significant injury,” the senators wrote. “Better information is needed to identify deficiencies in the training and use of these less lethal weapons ...” The Justice Department’s inspector general has launched an investigation of federal officers’ response to protest activity in Portland and Washington, D.C., the watchdog announced Thursday. Leaders of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Oversight committees this month had asked the office to review federal officers’ “violent tactics” used against protesters in those cities and elsewhere. And in California, several Democrat legislators introduced a measure in June that would ban the police use of less lethal munitions to disperse demonstrators. Except in riot conditions, the proposed law says, kinetic energy projectiles “shall not be used by any law enforcement agency against an assembly protected by the First Amendment.” Charles Mesloh, a former police officer, certified instructor and longtime researcher on less lethal weapons, said the status quo is “unacceptable,” but he sees little chance that national standards will be imposed for training, weapon safety and use. “I’ve been doing this long enough, I just – we’re just in a circle,” Mesloh said. “We’ll have some lip service ... and there'll be some mandated training, and then we’ll just go right back to where we were.” Carol Sobel, a Los Angeles civil rights attorney, keeps an unusual photo on her desk. It shows her with a goose-egg wound to her forehead and two black eyes. What’s not visible in the picture is the concussion, sinus fracture and more than six months of headaches. That’s the impact of a police projectile that struck her between the eyes as she stood outside the 2000 Democratic National Convention with a mainly peaceful crowd. ""My head snapped back and it hurt,"" she said. ""It was inconceivable to me that someone would shoot me in the face."" Over the past two decades, Los Angeles police have repeatedly used less lethal firepower on demonstrators, injuring hundreds and generating lawsuits that Sobel helped prosecute. Los Angeles police turned to bean bags as an alternative to live ammo after 1992 rioting triggered by the acquittal of officers who beat a Black man named Rodney King. As violence swept the city, police at first hunkered down, doing little to maintain order, then launched an aggressive crackdown. Ten people were killed by officers. In the aftermath, the department was criticized simultaneously for brutality and for failure to defend the community. Bean bag rounds and later 40mm projectiles emerged as options that were supposed to allow officers to protect themselves and the city without deaths or lawsuits. With the new arsenal, police in 2000 descended on protesters at MacArthur Park during the convention. Witnesses said demonstrators were shot in the back with rubber bullets as they tried to disperse. The city approved $4.1 million in payments to more than 90 people hurt during the melee. Among the shooting victims was Melissa Schneider, who secured a $1.4 million settlement after being blinded in one eye. Two decades later, Schneider said she still wakes up with excruciating pain where the eye used to be and frequently vomits as a result of migraines. Schneider said she was shaken watching internet videos of protesters injured in recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations:  “I immediately started sobbing – not for me, but for them and the journey they had ahead,” she said. “Things need to change. And it’s really sad. It’s been 20 years, and this is still happening.” Seven years after Schneider was maimed, Los Angeles police were back in MacArthur Park using batons, horses and less lethal rounds during a protest for immigrants' rights. More than 250 people were injured. An internal review determined projectiles were launched into crowds and at peaceful protesters. Although such weapons are supposed to be used to stop lawbreakers, no demonstrator was arrested. This time, city taxpayers forked out $13 million to settle civil complaints. The Police Department agreed to four years of court supervision, with rules banning the use of less lethal rounds against peaceful protesters. By 2015, amid a national controversy over police killings, Los Angeles police leaders were touting less lethal weapons as part of a kinder, gentler approach. The agency in 2017 adopted a progressive policy requiring officers to try de-escalation tactics before opening fire. But in May, when protests erupted after the death of George Floyd, police in Los Angeles unleashed bean bags and sponge rounds. A lawsuit filed by Black Lives Matter alleges “that the training of the LAPD in the use of these potentially lethal weapons was absent, seriously deficient, or intentionally indifferent to the known serious harm that can result.” The complaint, with Sobel as lead attorney, seeks an emergency ban on the use of less lethal arms for crowd control. Lawyers for the city argued a blanket ban would hamstring efforts to maintain law and order. Los Angeles police leaders declined to be interviewed for this article because it deals with personnel matters and issues that “will eventually be fleshed out in a complete, independent after-action report.” Sobel said she has seen it all before: “There is absolutely no institutional memory in the LAPD. That's No. 1. And No. 2 – they don't care."" Victoria Snelgrove leaned against a railing of a parking garage at Fenway Park, waiting for the crowd to dissipate so she could drive home from a raucous Red Sox celebration. Then Boston police fired the projectile that tore through her eye and into her brain. The home team had just defeated the New York Yankees to win the 2004 American League Championship. Sox fans rejoiced in the streets around the stadium. After some set fires and threw bottles, police began launching projectiles. Snelgrove, a 21-year-old college student and sports enthusiast who aspired to be an entertainment reporter on television, slipped into a coma. Her parents made the excruciating decision to remove life support hours later. The family collected $5 million in damages – reportedly the city’s largest settlement in history at the time. Snelgrove’s death spurred Boston police to convene a panel to figure out what went wrong. Among the commission findings: Boston had acquired its launchers less than a year earlier, without adequate understanding of safety issues. The manufacturer had suggested rounds would not break the skin. But a second protester had had a projectile lodged in his forehead, and a third suffered a gaping wound to the cheek. The commission said police needed more training on how to use less lethal weapons, particularly in crowd-control situations. It called for the National Institute of Justice to collect and disseminate comprehensive information on a burgeoning array of less lethal projectiles. And it urged the federal government to develop minimum safety standards with a testing program overseen by an independent agency such as the institute. Those recommendations were championed by Sen. Ted Kennedy, who said, ""The growing use and the false sense that they are completely safe are leading to the kind of avoidable tragedy that shocked all of us in Boston."" NIJ awarded grants to a Wayne State University researcher, Cynthia Bir, to help develop standards. Over several years, study groups were formed. Testing modes were developed. Then, according to Bir, Tasers and other equipment became more widely used by police. As interest in rubber bullets and bean bags waned, the Great Recession depleted funding. Research efforts dissolved along with prospects for standards for less lethal weapons. “NIJ gave us a fair amount of funding to look at this issue and then … the focus switched to Tasers,” Bir said. “Everything just kind of went away.” The NIJ did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment. Rick Wyant, a forensic scientist who served on an NIJ panel, said standards could be imposed by tying them to federal law enforcement grants. Otherwise, unregulated arms can continue putting the public at risk, he said. “I can go in my garage and develop something, and if I get a (police) chief to sign off on it and deploy it, that’s all that needs to happen,” Wyant said. U.S. law enforcement and defense agencies spend about $2.5 billion annually on less lethal weapons and ammunition, according to Anuj Mishra, an analyst with MarketsandMarkets, a research firm based in India. That's almost half the global total and includes sales of tear gas and Tasers as well as projectile weapons. Mishra said less lethal weapons sales have taken off with a proliferation of new products. More than a half-dozen companies supply U.S. police departments with plastic and rubber bullets, paintball-type rounds, launchers and less lethal projectiles fired from 12-gauge shotguns. Sales are driven by personal relationships, Internet advertising and trade shows where police try out the latest models on shooting ranges, industry executives say. “Cops are always looking for gadgets. They’re always looking for new technology,” said Eugene Paoline, professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida. “They like toys.” Less lethal weapons became part of a national conversation after the deadly 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager, in Ferguson, Missouri. As police agencies responded to protests with military-style tactics, criticism mounted from  medical, civil rights and activist groups that condemn the use of less lethal projectiles to break up demonstrations. Physicians for Human Rights, for example, contends that kinetic-impact bullets “are not an appropriate weapon to be used for crowd management, and specifically for dispersal purposes.” Rohini Haar, an emergency room physician and researcher at the University of California Berkeley, co-authored research in 2017 with Physicians for Human Rights on the damage inflicted by less lethal rounds. In a study of nearly 2,000 shooting victims, 3% died and 15% were permanently disabled. Haar’s takeaway: “Policing has to have a reckoning,” and that would include a ban on rubber bullets and more regulation of all less lethal weapons in crowd-control scenarios. By contrast, police and government inquiries after the Ferguson protests resulted in no clear guidelines for the use of plastic and bean bag rounds.  A task force created by President Obama, which urged federal investigations of inappropriate use of police equipment and tactics during demonstrations, recommended little more than “annual training.” Eleven of the nation’s top law enforcement leadership organizations in 2017 developed what they called a National Consensus Policy on Use of Force. The white paper lacks detailed direction for less lethal munitions while stressing that even vague guidance is “not intended to be a national standard by which all agencies are held accountable.” In the aftermath of George Floyd demonstrations, that report was updated earlier this month. But wording on less lethal weaponry remained the same: It urges police to ban martial arts weapons such as blackjacks and nunchucks, but avoids a recommendation on less lethal projectiles, leaving decisions to individual agencies. Terrence Cunningham, who took part in the review as president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said after inquiries for this story that he now supports a consensus policy for less lethal munitions. “We definitely need some kind of foundational standards,” said Cunningham, now the association’s deputy executive director. Meanwhile, the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit think tank, last year convened 225 police chiefs, officers, industry representatives and academics for yet another symposium on police use of force. The forum's 45-page report endorses less lethal arms as a sometimes controversial part of the law enforcement toolkit and emphasizes that the weapons ""often do not work as desired."" Law enforcement experts point out there are about 18,000 police forces in the United States, and it may be impossible to develop homogeneous standards or practices that work in communities ranging from New York City to Minooka, Illinois. “Most agencies in America are 50 people or less. They don’t have big budgets,” said Don Kester, head of training for the National Tactical Officer Association. “You write a (detailed) policy and all the chiefs say you’ve created an unfunded mandate” for equipment and training. The alternative – and the reality – is a system where each agency decides which weapons to use, what training to provide, and what policies to enforce. All operate on the same underlying function, as spelled out by Ed Obayashi, an attorney and deputy chief of California’s Plumas County Sheriff’s Office: “to inflict pain to gain compliance and to disperse a crowd.” If protesters ignore police instructions, he added, firing on the overall crowd could be justified depending on circumstances. Obayashi allowed that videos taken during recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations presented “bad optics” for less lethal weapons. But a full story can’t be presented from films, he said while asserting that the overall response by U.S. peace officers was “very controlled and did not cause a measurable number of serious injuries.” “When law enforcement gives an order to disperse, and that doesn’t happen, we don’t have a lot of options,” agreed Wade Carpenter, the police chief in Park City, Utah, who oversees IACP’s firearms and tactical committees. “Whenever we have individuals that are trying to incite these riots, there is a level of force that has to be used.” If Scott Olsen struggles to recall what happened when police shot him with a bean bag round, his sentiments about the Oakland Police Department are crystal clear: “I think bad things,” Olsen, now 33, said in a recent phone interview. The projectile that struck Olsen’s head in 2011 was launched despite previous, similar incidents that resulted in lawsuits, independent investigations, court orders and police reforms. James Chanin, an Oakland attorney who filed some of the civil actions, and won settlements, tells about a “long history of alleged civil rights violations” by the city’s police force. In April 2003, protesters against the Iraq War blocked a Port of Oakland entrance at a marine terminal. A lawsuit described how police moved to break up the demonstration, firing wooden dowels to skip them off the ground at protesters, shooting bean bag rounds into the crowd, and setting off stinger grenades that scattered chemical irritants and small balls. Sri Louise Coles, a lead plaintiff in one of the cases, alleged that she suffered face and neck wounds from a projectile and additional injuries when an officer rammed her with a motorcycle. In settling that case, Oakland agreed to new crowd-control and management policies. Less lethal munitions “shall not be used for crowd management, crowd control or crowd dispersal,” the policy instructed, and such devices “may never be used indiscriminately against a crowd or group of persons.” Eight years later, Olsen was near the front of an Occupy Oakland demonstration when police declared the gathering an illegal assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse. Officers then launched a fusillade of less lethal munitions, including the round that struck Olsen. As other protesters rushed to his aid, an Oakland police officer deployed a chemical canister into the group, an independent investigation commissioned by the city later found. Police said afterward that they did not see Olsen had been wounded, so they did not fulfill a mandatory requirement to render medical aid and immediately start a formal investigation of the shooting. The independent investigation called the police department's account “unsettling and not believable.” The investigation also said the decision to use less lethal munitions “may or may not have been reasonable” based on the police department’s existing policy at the time. “We recommend that further research should be conducted to identify and evaluate other munitions that are less prone to cause injuries, but are still effective as crowd control devices,” the investigators concluded. The final report compared the city’s crowd-control effort to an aviation disaster caused not by a single mistake, but by “a series of cascading events.” In Oakland’s case, the tragedy stemmed in part from  years of “diminishing resources,” and “increasing workload.” The city ultimately agreed to a $4.5 million settlement with Olsen. Once again, Oakland revised policies and training. For several years, Chanin said, the cycle of protests, shootings and lawsuits seemed to stop. Then George Floyd demonstrations broke out, and so did the less lethal weapons. According to a federal complaint filed in June by the Anti Police-Terror Project, Oakland officers indiscriminately launched projectiles, flashbangs and tear gas into crowds and at individuals. Attorneys for both sides in the case stipulated to an agreement that forbids Oakland police from using less lethal weapons against demonstrators. For Olsen, now tending bee colonies and chickens on a small Wisconsin farm, the memory with a hole came flooding back. “We passed these regulations and policies to control the use of less lethal weapons,” he said. “It’s heartbreaking to see other people’s lives affected as mine was. … Police have shown they do not care about these kinds of controls, so the next step is to take those weapons away from them.” Graphics: Javier Zarracina and Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY.

police settlement,https://www.startribune.com/las-vegas-police-reach-2-2m-settlement-in-chokehold-death/571810202/,Las Vegas police reach $2.2M settlement in chokehold death,"LAS VEGAS — The family of a man who was punched, hit with stun gun jolts and put in a neck restraint by a police officer outside a Las Vegas casino in 2017 has reached a tentative $2.2 million settlement with police. Boris Treyzon, an attorney for the family of Tashii Brown, said the agreement settles a lawsuit filed on behalf of Brown's children that accused Las Vegas police of excessive force and gross negligence in the 40-year-old's death. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement that ""an amicable resolution"" was reached but the settlement will go before the department's Fiscal Affairs Committee for approval. The department confirmed to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the proposed settlement would be the largest in the department's history. The department said it could not comment further until the committee takes action. Kenneth Lopera, the officer who used the unapproved chokehold on Brown, was fired after the department said he violated use-of-force policies. Lopera then became the first Las Vegas police officer to face a manslaughter charge since 1990 in a city where police shootings and uses of force drew reform recommendations in 2012 from the U.S. Justice Department. The charge against Lopera came after the Clark County coroner ruled that Brown was asphyxiated as a result of the police neck restraint. Medical examiners also noted that Brown had an enlarged heart and methamphetamine in his system when he died. In 2018, all criminal charges against Lopera, also including oppression under color of office, were dropped after legal representatives from his police union presented evidence to a criminal grand jury that Brown's death was due to his heart ailment and drug use. The grand jury refused to indict. The settlement in the case with Brown's children releases the police department and Lopera from the lawsuit. A message left Friday with Lopera's attorney was not returned. A separate lawsuit filed by Brown's mother, Trinita Farmer, is pending in federal court. © 2020 StarTribune. All rights reserved."
police settlement,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/seattle-police-chief-new-limits-on-anti-protest-gear-will-mean-adjusted-law-enforcement/ar-BB17aBe9,Seattle police chief: New limits on anti-protest gear will mean 'adjusted' law enforcement,"Seattle's police officers will now respond to protests and rioting through “adjusted deployment” methods because of a new city law that bans them from using some crowd-control tools, the city's police chief said Friday. The new law, which takes effect Sunday, “bans Seattle Police officers the use of less lethal tools, including pepper spray that is commonly used to disperse crowds that have turned violent,” police Chief Carmen Best said in a statement. “Simply put,"" Best added, ""the legislation gives officers NO ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd."" City Council Ordinance 119805, issued by the City Council earlier this week, bans tear gas, blast balls and other anti-protest gear used to disperse crowds and protect officers when crowds turn violent. U.S. District Judge James Robart ruled Wednesday that the City Council’s plan could proceed -- despite an attempt by Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Best to stop the plan. The mayor and the police chief submitted a motion arguing that the new law would conflict with an eight-year-old settlement on a policing-overhaul agreement struck between the Seattle Police Department and the U.S. Justice Department. The police overhaul was prompted by Justice Department findings pointing to patterns of biased policing and excessive use of force by Seattle officers. Durkan and Best had argued to Robart that the new city law might interfere with terms of the accord struck with the Justice Department. “It is important to bring to your attention that yesterday, I sent the City Council a letter ensuring them that as the Chief of Police, I have done my due diligence of informing them numerous times of the foreseeable impact of this ordinance on upcoming events,” Best said Friday. “For these reasons,"" she continued, ""Seattle Police will have an adjusted deployment in response to any demonstrations this weekend – as I will never ask our officers to risk their personal safety to protect property without the tools to do so in a safe way.” Best’s announcement came less than a week after body-camera footage showed rioters throwing objects at Seattle officers last Sunday, resulting in injuries to 12 officers."
police settlement,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/federal-judge-blocks-seattle-council-s-law-banning-police-anti-riot-gear/ar-BB17ancx,Federal judge blocks Seattle council’s law banning police anti-riot gear,"In a ruling Friday night, a federal judge blocked a new Seattle law prohibiting police from using pepper spray and other anti-riot weapons. The new law was set to take effect Sunday but U.S. District Judge James Robart granted a request by the federal government to block the measure, the Seattle Times reported. The Seattle City Council passed the new law unanimously last month, hoping to reduce violent clashes between police and protesters. But the U.S. Justice Department argued that the inability to use pepper spray, blast balls and other devices might actually lead to more police use of force, not less, the Times reported. In his ruling, Robart determined that the situation required further discussion between the city and the Justice Department, which years ago entered a settlement agreement regarding a police department overhaul because of past complaints about excessive force and biased policing. Robart called his restraining order blocking the law “very temporary,” and advised the city and the Justice Department to engage in constructive discussions regarding the next step. “I urge you all to use it as an occasion to try to find out where it is we are and where it is we’re going,” he said, according to the Times. “I can’t tell youy today if blast balls are a good idea or a bad idea, but I know that sometime a long time ago I approved them.” Prior to the judge’s Friday ruling, Seattle police Chief Carmen Best, in anticipation of the new law taking effect Sunday, announced plans for “adjusted deployment” methods that she said were designed to protect police officers who would lack access to the anti-riot weapons. But the judge’s Friday ruling move the chief’s plans moot – at least for now. Meanwhile, on Thursday, a federal government plan arrived in Seattle, carrying federal law enforcement officers who were expected to be deployed this weekend to protect federal buildings from any possible rioting. They would augment the deployment of local police. Robart is the presiding judge in the 2012 consent decree that required Seattle city officials to address the past allegations of excessive force and biased policing."

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

U.S. District Judge James Robart’s decision defeated an attempt by Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and police Chief Carmen Best to stop the plan, scheduled to take effect Sunday, the Seattle Times reported. The ruling follows a U.S. Justice Department determination that Seattle police had routinely used excessive force and displayed evidence of biased policing – assessments that prompted a police department overhaul, the newspaper reported. But Durkan and Best argued that the council’s new law, stripping the police of “crowd control” gear, could conflict with terms of a settlement deal reached by the city and the Justice Department regarding the police overhaul, according to the report. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, right, speaks to reporters at City Hall in Seattle, with police Chief Carmen Best at left. (Associated Press) The council passed its plan unanimously June 15, after Seattle police faced criticism for allegedly using the gear against mostly peaceful protesters – just as the department was drawing closer to the end of federal oversight, the Times reported. In his ruling, Robart noted that Durkan and Best failed to oppose other attempts to limit police use of crowd-control weapons. On Tuesday, Seattle police released bodycam footage showing rioters throwing objects at them last Sunday, resulting in injuries to at least 12 officers. Robart, 72, a Seattle native, was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in 2004 by former President George W. Bush.

Brown, the family’s attorney. Wayne Jones, a black man who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was killed by police officers after they stopped him for walking in the road in March 2013. The case was dismissed three times before a federal appeals judge reversed the lower court last month in a powerful message against police use of deadly force. “I promised my mother before she died that we would continue to fight for justice,” said Bruce Jones, Wayne Jones’s 57-year-old brother and one of the beneficiaries of the settlement. “The settlement makes me feel a little bit better, but until I can have a chance to have these cops prosecuted, I am still going to be pushing for justice,” he said. In a statement, the Martinsburg Police Department stressed that the settlement is not an admission of guilt in the  killing. “The City’s insurance carrier, in consultation with the City and its officers, agreed to the settlement simply to avoid the ongoing costs of litigation and the difficulties a trial would present for Mr. Jones’ family, the Officers, and the Officers’ families,” the statement said. The statement also detailed three independent investigations of the incident that found insufficient evidence to establish that police officers had violated Jones’s rights, referring to reviews by the West Virginia State Police, the U.S. Justice Department and the department’s Civil Rights Division   in 2013. “With this settlement, the City and the MPD hope everyone involved will be able to put this incident behind them and allow the community to heal,” the city said in the statement. The settlement ends a seven-year legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled last month that officers who shot and killed Jones were not immune to the family’s lawsuit. The court’s ruling came in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in the custody of Minneapolis police. “Although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split second decisions, we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of black lives,” wrote Judge Henry F. Floyd, who referred to the police killings of Floyd in May and Michael Brown in 2014 in his ruling. He continued, “This has to stop.” Though the protracted civil case has been settled, Jones’s family has another petition on appeal in state court that would impanel a grand jury to investigate the shooting, according to Brown, the family’s attorney. “The fact that I could tell my client that we still have a shot at criminal prosecution made the figure very acceptable,” Brown said of the settlement. “My clients want the police who work there to lose their pension, lose their jobs and go to jail for murdering their brother.” The fatal shooting occurred in 2013 when Jones, then 50 and homeless, was stopped by police for walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk. The encounter escalated when Jones did not comply with an officer’s order to put his hands on the police car. A chase ensued and Jones was shocked with a Taser, kicked and placed in a chokehold before one officer felt a “sharp poke at [his] side” and shouted that Jones had a knife, according to court records. A semicircle of five officers closed in around Jones and, court records show, collectively fired 22 bullets at him as he lay motionless on the ground. Jones’s family sued the city and the police officers alleging excessive use of force, but a district court judge initially found that the officers were protected from legal action by qualified immunity. The June ruling reversed that decision. Bruce Jones, who said most of the money from the settlement will go toward attorney fees that have piled up over seven years of litigation, is doing his best to honor his brother, who would have turned 58 on July 28. “I think about him not being here anymore and not having the chance to see his nephews and nieces and family,” he said. “To say we won would be to have these officers indicted for the crimes that they committed.” Ann E.

police settlement,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/07/22/us/ap-us-police-excessive-force-suit.html,Family of Black Man Shot 22 Times by Police Settles Lawsuit,"MARTINSBURG, W.Va. — A West Virginia city has agreed to settle an excessive force lawsuit filed by the family of a homeless Black man who was shot 22 times by police, an attorney said. Christopher E. Brown, the attorney for the family of Wayne Arnold Jones, told The Washington Post that the lawsuit was settled for $3.5 million. “I promised my mother before she died that we would continue to fight for justice,” Jones' brother, Bruce Jones, told the newspaper. “The settlement makes me feel a little bit better, but until I can have a chance to have these cops prosecuted, I am still going to be pushing for justice.” The Martinsburg Police Department said in a statement that the settlement was not an admission of guilt. Police had stopped Wayne Jones as he was walking on a Martinsburg street. Jones was shot after police said the 50-year-old Stephens City, Virginia, resident shrugged off two jolts from a stun gun, fought with officers and stabbed one of them. The officers are white. U.S. District Judge Gina Groh had dismissed the lawsuit. But a three-member federal appeals court panel reversed the granting of summary judgment to the officers on qualified immunity grounds last month, saying that “a reasonable jury could find that Jones was both secured and incapacitated in the final moments before his death.” The court also referenced the Memorial Day death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis after white police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck for several minutes. That death prompted protests by millions of people around the world The appeals panel noted that “although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split-second decisions, we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of black lives. This has to stop.” The police department's statement said the city's insurance carrier agreed to the settlement to avoid the ongoing costs of litigation along with the stress that a trial would bring to the officers and the families of the officers and Jones. The city of Martinsburg said in the statement that ""with this settlement, the City and the MPD hope everyone involved will be able to put this incident behind them and allow the community to heal.” A Berkeley County grand jury declined to indict the officers in the shooting. The U.S. Justice Department later said there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal civil rights charges against police. Civil rights leaders had pressed for the investigation. The Jones family has filed a separate appeal in state court seeking a grand jury investigation, Brown said. “The fact that I could tell my client that we still have a shot at criminal prosecution made the (settlement) figure very acceptable,” Brown said."

In a statement, the sheriff’s office said the unidentified deputy had been assisting Woodstock police during the June 17 arrest of four people. Woodstock police Chief John Lieb said they were suspects in the theft of two riding lawn mowers and a trailer from a Blaine’s Farm and Fleet.

SARASOTA COUNTY — The Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office announced Friday they have identified a 21-year-old Sarasota man who allegedly defaced two local synagogues with anti-Semitic images and phrases. An investigation began April 2 when security cameras captured an unidentified man spray-painting multiple swastikas on the outside walls of Temple Emanu-El, at 151 McIntosh Road. A vandal struck again on July 15. Video surveillance shows a man, believed to be the same individual, spray-painting swastikas and anti-Semitic graffiti at both Temple Emanu-El and another synagogue, Temple Sinai, at 4631 S. Lockwood Ridge Road. Following the release of security camera images and video from each incident, detectives received tips from the public identifying Vincent Martinez, 21, of Sarasota as a possible suspect. An investigation revealed that Martinez used a nearby ATM approximately 20 minutes after the first incident occurred wearing similar clothing seen in security footage. Detectives linked him to the second two incidents through cellphone records. ""The Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office takes hate crimes such as these very seriously,"" said Col. Kurt A. Hoffman. ""Our detectives worked tirelessly with help from the community to bring this case to a successful conclusion."" Martinez faces three counts of criminal mischief by defacing and damaging a synagogue, a third-degree felony punishable by a fine up to $5,000 and five years in jail. He is currently at a secure medical facility pending his arrest on warrants issued Wednesday. Rabbi Elaine Rose Glickman of Temple Emanu-El said her congregation is grateful for the work of the Sheriff’s Office to find the individual involved. ""We at Temple Emanu-El have been so uplifted by support we have received from people and organizations around the community,"" Glickman said. ""It has meant so much in a dark time."" While the alleged perpetrator is young, Glickman said she hopes that justice can lead to learning. ""There is always time to learn and change our ways and always time to move toward fairness and justice and tolerance and openness and love,"" she said. ""Right now, Jewish communities all over the world are preparing for our high holidays. We look to our deeds of the past year and look ahead. We look at ways we might change."" Ellen Bender, president of Temple Sinai, shared Glickman’s hope that the alleged vandal could be educated. She was relieved that a suspect had been arrested. ""Frankly, I am actually shocked that this was a very young fellow — 21 years old,"" Bender said. ""I don’t know how you build up that much hate at such a young age. We are relieved he has been apprehended. ""I hope he has some sort of education about what it means to be Jewish. What it means to be part of a community, an interfaith community. I have no understanding where this kind of hate comes from."" The Jewish Federation of Sarasota has established a $100,000 matching gift to help raise funds to secure the safety of the Jewish Community after the two incidents of anti-Semitic graffiti. The Jewish Federation’s leadership is investing the money from its board-restricted endowment fund. Howard Tevlowitz, Chief Executive Officer, said, ""As anti-Semitism increases around the country and now, right here in our own backyard in Sarasota-Manatee, we must take action. The response must be twofold. We must keep our Jewish houses of worship safe and eradicate anti-Semitism at its core by education."" According to the Federation, the ""Keep Us Safe"" fund will go toward upgrades in security technology and cameras at area synagogues and organizations, the hiring of additional security guards and many more educational programs about anti-Semitism and the Holocaust for schools, universities and the general community. The fund will also help to cover the pay of a recently hired community security director, who will work with area synagogues and Jewish agencies on their safety protocols.

Coverage starting at 5 on @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/o9Tn6d1Vvt Another dash camera video shows Parrish with his hands and feet restrained, being carried and forcefully put inside a cruiser. In another video, Parrish can be heard saying, “I can’t breathe.” There also are claims in the lawsuit that go beyond what can be seen in the video. Channel 9′s Joe Bruno first learned about the lawsuit Wednesday night. He has spoken with the Parrish’s attorney and a police expert about the case. According to the lawsuit, the traffic stop began with Parrish in a car with someone who had a protective order out against him. A deputy recognized the vehicle, followed the pair and pulled the car over. A deputy struck Parrish in the face at least 20 times, according to federal court documents. He was put in a chokehold, hit with pepper spray and stunned with a Taser twice. Deputies eventually put a spit bag over Parrish’s head. The documents said Parrish was denied water to flush his eyes and begged for help when the sheriff came to the scene. The lawsuit claims Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey laughed at him and said, “I can’t help you.” The documents said Parrish spent more than 200 days in jail and was denied prescribed medication for the first three months, which led to a hospital stay. Among several things, Parrish is alleging excessive force, assault and due process violations. His attorney said deputies went too far. “This case is about bullies with badges,” attorney Bo Caudill said. “Dustin Parrish was pulled over for committing a crime and instead of pulling him over and treating him with basic human dignity that every person deserves to be treated with, certain deputies with the Union County Sheriff’s Office beat him up.” The Union County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. Channel 9 spoke with Scott McClatchie, who is a use of force expert and specializes in police encounters. He said punching is a tactic police use during resistance. “I saw a deputy on his back,” McClatchie said. “If I was responding to a backup call on a fight or a struggle, and I saw a fellow officer on his back or the ground, I’d be pretty concerned.” The attorney for Parrish denies he was resisting. © 2020 Cox Media Group.

			Coronavirus: East Bay jail numbers up, but most are asymptomatic, sheriff office says		

	
	","GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. DUBLIN — Although a total of 103 inmates at the Santa Rita Jail are currently positive with coronavirus, a majority of them are not showing any symptoms, according to the sheriff’s office. “This virus is very different,” said Alameda County Sheriff’s spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly in an interview on Wednesday. As of Wednesday morning, there were 103 inmates who tested positive for the coronavirus; of those, 91 are asymptomatic, meaning they showed none of the typical signs of COVID-19. As many inmates as possible are now being tested, whether they show symptoms. The surge in inmates went up dramatically within the past week — just a week ago, there were only six inmates that had been diagnosed with the virus. Then on Thursday, about 40 tested positive, and the next day, another 55. On Tuesday, there were 106 inmates total who had tested positive for COVID-19 — 100 more patients in less than a week’s time. Kelly said jail officials began testing “as much as we can.” At the start of the pandemic, there weren’t many tests available, so only symptomatic inmates and those at-risk were being tested, he said. Then, all those who were arrested and newly arrived at Santa Rita were tested after two weeks of being in the jail. Now, more massive testing is being conducted. All those inmates who have tested positive are now contained in housing units 22, 25 and 8. The first group that tested positive last week was in housing unit 25, and then housing unit 22 was tested out of precaution, he said. “What we’re worried about, is could you be positive and asymptomatic for two weeks and get cleared? And then a month later be COVID-19 positive again?” Kelly said. “We don’t know that.” He said if more infected inmates are asymptomatic, they could be spreading the virus to others. “We know for a fact in our jail, the only way for COVID to enter is for it to come in,” Kelly said. That could mean from people who are arrested and newly arrived at the jail, employees or contractors. He said the jail could benefit from a rapid-testing system — a technology that exists but hasn’t been made readily available yet. If tests had a shorter turn-around,  such as 15 minutes, then those entering the jail who were positive could be better managed. In the initial surge last week, the inmates who tested positive last Wednesday were from Housing Unit 25, and worked either in the kitchen or laundry. The kitchen has third-party contractors who work with the inmates to prepare food for the jail. The jail is conducting “contact tracing” to determine where the virus could have originated from. The jail has also seen its employees and contractors test positive for the virus. As of Wednesday, there were 10 current staff or contractors who had tested positive with active cases. In all, there have been 44 staff/contractors who have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began. As of Wednesday, there are 1,882 total inmates at the jail. The nearby low-security Dublin Federal Correctional Institution has reported only one inmate who tested positive with the virus and two staff members. It has a total population of 987 female inmates. The federal facility is where actress Felicity Huffman served her 14-day sentence last year."

			Solano County Sheriff, Public Defender probing jail sergeant’s testy interaction with deputy public defender over Black Lives Matter face mask		

	
	","GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. Solano County Sheriff Tom Ferrara and Public Defender Elena D’Agustino are investigating a reported testy interaction between a correctional sergeant and a deputy public defender in the Alternate Public Defender Office who wore a Black Lives Matter face mask while seeking to visit her jailed client in late June. The separate investigations are ongoing and neither Ferrara nor D’Agustino, who also oversees the APD Office, declined to comment or issue statements until the investigations are complete. In an email to The Reporter, Deputy Le’Ron Cummings, public information officer for the Sheriff’s Office, said Ferrara was “aware of the interaction” between Sgt. Cody D. White and Defense Attorney Shelly Saini. “The County is currently investigating the incident to gain a better understanding of what occurred,” Cummings wrote. “We understand this can be an emotional issue but it would be irresponsible of us to form a conclusion or make or comment on the situation until we gather all the facts on what occurred prior to making a statement.” Also in an email, D’Agustino wrote that allegations about White’s behavior, including, reportedly, that he would file a formal complaint about Saini wearing the BLM mask, remain for the time being “an internal matter that we are still in the process of investigating.” The interaction between White and Saini was first reported by davisvanguard.org, a nonprofit, Davis-based news organization that covers the city of Davis and Yolo County courts and other regional news. By the news site’s account, Saini, a woman of South Asian descent, attempted to enter the downtown Fairfield jail to visit her client on June 24 when she was confronted by White, who “took issue” with her face covering. When she arrived at the jail, the entrance was locked. She asked the sergeant if she could enter. Saini replied that it was a mask — it read “ADO for Black Lives Matter” — and again asked how she could enter the building. The sergeant’s only response was that it was open, but Saini demonstrated, by pulling on the door, that it wasn’t. White then questioned her about why she was at the door, and she replied that she was there to see her client. At this time, another officer inside the building, who was not identified in the davisvanguard account, unlocked the door. While Saini spoke with this officer, White allegedly “began to raise his voice” and demanded to know who she works for. When Saini told him she works for the county, the sergeant replied he would be filing a complaint. White later contacted D’Agustino and, according to the account’s author, asserted “a baseless claim” that Saini’s mask amounts to political activity barred by county policy and told D’Agustino he’d be filing a formal complaint. “The sergeant’s threat to file a formal complaint and direct contact with Ms. Saini’s boss, simply because he disagrees with the phrase ADO for Black Lives, reflect a misguided attempt to silence Ms. Saini that will not be tolerated,” the account’s author wrote. The editorial board at davisvanguard.org includes, among others, Robert Canning, a licensed clinical psychologist who is retired from the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; Cecilia Escamilla Greenwald, who currently serves on the Police Accountability Commission for the city of Davis; Nora Oldwin, an attorney and neighborhood activist; Cres Velluci, a longtime daily newspaper and wire service reporter and editor and board member of the National Lawyers Guild of Sacramento; and Joshua Kaizuka, a private attorney who formerly worked for Yolo County Public Defender. The davisvanguard account was signed by more than 60 Solano County defense attorneys, some who work for the county, many of them public defenders, and others in private practice. One of them, Robert M. Boyle, a deputy public defender in the Alternate Public Defender Office, responded to a Reporter request for comment, writing that government employees are entitled to First Amendment free speech rights “based on longstanding U.S. Supreme Court and California Supreme Court precedent.” In apparent further defense of Saini’s desire to visit her jailed client, Boyle wrote: “As lawyers who are the front line representatives of many individuals who are not deserving of the treatment they receive in the justice system, it would be derelict of our duties to those clients, our oaths to uphold the United States and California Constitutions, and our commitments to achieving real justice if we do not zealously advocate for the interests of our clients.” Saini on Wednesday did not return a request for comment about her interaction with White. The correctional sergeant could not be reached at the Solano County Jail."

(AP) — Two brothers and a woman have been arrested in connection with the “massacre"" of three best friends who set out on a fishing trip at a central Florida lake last week, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Wednesday. One of the suspects, Tony “TJ"" Wiggins, 26, had previously been charged with 230 felonies, and had been consistently arrested since he was 12, Judd said during a news conference to announce the arrests. His bother William Robert Wiggins, 21, and girlfriend Mary Whittemore, 27, were also arrested. They are accused in the shooting and beating deaths of Damion Tillman, 23; Keven Springfield, 30; and Brandon Rollins, 27; on Friday night as they gathered at a remote boat ramp at Lake Streety near Frostproof. Judd, who has worked at the agency since 1972 called the crime scene “horrific,"" describing the deaths as a “massacre."" He said the men were beaten and “shot up."" “I’ve been to a lot of murder scenes in my life, and this ranks among the worst,” Judd said during a Saturday news conference. According to the sheriff, Tillman was at a Dollar General store in the area and mentioned he was meeting his friends to go fishing at the lake. The store clerk later told investigators the suspects were in the store and overheard Tillman saying he was meeting up with his friends. Judd said Tony Wiggins told his brother to drive to the lake. Once there, Tony Wiggins confronted Springfield, accusing him of stealing his truck and selling the engine. Judd said investigators have not yet determined whether that allegation is true. The brother told detectives Tony Wiggins shot all three victims, then asked him to help put Tillman in the back of a truck. The sheriff said the trio then went to a McDonald's and ordered 10 double cheeseburgers and two chicken sandwiches. Rollins was still alive when the attackers left, Judd said. He called his father for help. The father arrived about 10 minutes later but forget his cellphone in a rush to help his son, so he went to a convenience store to get help. By the time help arrived, his son had died. Detectives received tips about the case and obtained video from the store. During a search warrant at the suspects' homes, investigators found a gun that killed the victims, Judd said. Tony Wiggins is charged with first-degree murder, tampering with evidence and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. His bother and girlfriend are each charged with accessory after the fact. All three were expected to appear before a judge Thursday afternoon. Attorneys for them were not listed on court records. Earlier, Judd had announced a reward of $30,000 leading to arrests in the case."

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Wednesday he simply could not explain why a suspected ringleader arrested in connection with the brutal murders of three Florida friends during a fishing trip had been on the streets, rather than behind bars. In an interview on ""The Daily Briefing,"" Judd explained that 26-year-old Tony ""TJ"" Wiggins had 230 felony charges already under his belt. ""And, he’s out on bond for jumping on a guy and breaking his arm with a crowbar,"" he said. ""This guy is evil in the flesh. And, he murdered, he massacred three guys simply going fishing on Friday night near Frostproof, Florida."" Wiggins, his 21-year-old brother William ""Robert"" Wiggins, and Robert's 27-year-old girlfriend, Mary Whittemore, were all charged in last week's Frostproof killings. Damion Tillman, 23, Keven Springfield, 30, and 27-year-old Brandon Rollins all died. Wiggins' criminal history dated back to when he was 12 years old. He had 15 convictions and has two stints in state prison on his record. His brother has been charged with tampering with evidence and accessory. Whittemore has been charged with accessory after the fact of capital felony. ""Why, sheriff, is this guy on the streets?"" host Trace Gallagher asked. ""I have no explanation for that,"" Judd replied. ""He has -- you look at Florida statute... he’s done it all. He recently broke someone’s arm."" Tony ""TJ"" Wiggins, 26, (left) was the alleged ringleader behind the ""massacre."" His girlfriend, Mary Whittemore, 27, (center) and his brother Robert Wiggins, 21, (right) have also been arrested. (Polk County Sheriff) ""At the end of the day, he had a happenstance meeting with a young man, Damion that was going fishing. And, Damion mentioned: 'I'm going fishing with Kevin.' So, he told his brother Robert, 'follow him to the lake.' When he got there, he took his gun out and murdered all three of the people,"" the sheriff added. Judd said the killings seemed to stem from an argument over the elder Wiggins' truck. Investigators said Tillman apparently arrived at the lake first to meet his friends. When Rollins and Springfield arrived, they saw their friend being beaten. The attackers then turned on them and began shooting. Rollins was still alive when the attackers left and called his father for help. His father rushed to the fishing spot about 10 minutes away but forgot his cellphone in the hurry to help his son. He drove to a nearby convenience store, and the clerk helped him call the cops but, by the time they arrived, Rollins had died. The other two men died shortly afterward. Following the brutal assassinations, the three suspects drove to McDonald's, where they ordered 10 double cheeseburgers and two McChicken sandwiches, investigators said. In addition, the next morning, Robert Wiggins took his truck to a car wash in Lake Wales to wash the clay from it. There was an intense manhunt for the killers and a reward for information leading to an arrest in the case had already ballooned to $30,000. TJ Wiggins had been arrested in March for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was released on bond. However, because he allegedly killed Tillman, Springfield, and Rollins while he was out on bond, he violated his pretrial release conditions and is therefore not allowed to bond out on the new charges. ""It was violent. It was horrible. And there was absolutely no reason,"" Judd said. ""This was a happenstance meeting. He just heard that Kevin was going to fish with Damion, and this -- and he snapped. He showed up. He had Robert, his brother, drive him there. And, Robert and his girlfriend Mary tried to hide evidence. But, our detectives -- who are simply the very best -- solved this case with the work and help of the community,"" he concluded.

FROSTPROOF — Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said detectives have arrested two men and a woman responsible for the fatal shootings of three friends found dead while they were headed to a fishing trip near Frostproof on Friday night. At a news conference Wednesday, Judd identified the suspects as Tony “T.J.” Wiggins, 26; his girlfriend Mary Whittemore, 27; and Wiggins’ brother William “Robert” Wiggins, 21. Among the leads that drew detectives to the suspects were hundreds of tips to the Heartland Crime Stoppers line. “‘Look at T.J. Wiggins from Frostproof,‘” Judd quoted some of the callers saying. “Not because they had any idea he did it, just because he’s mean.” Tony Wiggins was first arrested at age 12 and has a history of 230 felony charges including battery and weapons charges, Judd said. He has been convicted 15 times and served two terms in state prison, Judd said. “He’s wild and he’s out of control.” A video recording shows that the fatal encounter apparently began when the victims and suspects ran into each other Friday night at a nearby Dollar General Store, Judd said. In describing the shooting scene, the sheriff said T.J. Wiggins screamed at one of the victims, “You stole the engine out of my truck.” “The only evidence we have,” Judd said, “is that T.J.is mad over some kind of truck deal that happened a long time ago.” All the suspects and victims are from the Lake Wales and Frostproof area. The victims were beaten and shot to death as they were heading to Lake Streety near Frostproof to go fishing, Judd said. They are Damion Tillman, 23, Keven Springfield, 30, and Brandon Rollins, 27. “What’s messed up is that Keven and Tony knew each other,” said Keri Black, a longtime friend of victims Brandon Rollins and Keven Springfield and the mother of five of Springfield’s eight children. “They all knew each other. They grew up together.” “T.J.” Wiggins was a familiar face at local hangouts in Frostproof. He wasn’t a close friend of the three victims, but he wasn’t an enemy either, Black told the Times on Wednesday. No one was, she said. “All three of them shared a really, really gentle soul,” Black said. “Keven would do anything and everything for anybody, without question. He was loving and kind to everyone he ever met.” Tony Wiggins ran into victim Tillman in line at the Dollar General Store 9:56 p.m. Friday as Tillman was buying supplies for the fishing trip. Wiggins learned through a clerk at the store that Springfield was going on the trip, too. Wiggins and the other two suspects followed Tillman out of the store. Ten minutes later, a fatally wounded Rollins placed a frantic cell phone call to his father, saying only, “Help.” Investigators soon identified the three suspects, and on Monday, located them “off the grid” in a wooded family compound of camper trailers, Judd said. Investigators found two shotguns and two rifles in a gun safe at Wiggins’ trailer and arrested him. He was out on bail at the time, following an arrest in March on charges including aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Investigators also located a single shell casing from a 9 mm pistol in Wiggins’ trailer that matched the Smith & Wesson handgun used in the shootings. William Wiggins and Whittemore agreed to be interviewed by detectives. Whittemore admitted buying ammunition before the shooting then stopped cooperating. William Wiggins provided more details. Detectives learned that the suspects had no plans to go to the lake until Tony Wiggins decided to follow Tillman. William Wiggins was driving a pickup truck carrying the suspects when they pulled up to find the three friends parked side by side in two pickups on Lake Streety Road. They were talking to one another, Tillman in his truck and Springfield at the wheel of other with Rollins in Springfield’s passenger seat. Tony Wiggins and Tillman got out of their trucks. Wiggins pulled a handgun and pushed Tillman, yelling, “Where’s Keven?” Wiggins spotted Springfield sitting in the truck, ran toward and him and pointed the gun at him, demanding, “Where’s my truck? You sold the engine out of my truck.” Springfield, who worked as an auto tech, replied that he didn’t know what Wiggins was talking about. Wiggins struck Springfield. Tillman screamed repeatedly from the other truck, “Put the gun away!” “T.J.‘s out of control screaming, ‘Where’s my truck,’ and he starts shooting Keven and Brandon inside the white truck,” Judd said. The two were hit about nine or 10 times. Wiggins then shot Tillman several times as Tillman sat in his truck, he said. William Wiggins said he was not involved in the shootings but afterward, helped lift Tillman and place him in the back of one of the pickups, Judd said. Whittemore declined to talk to investigators about the incident and lied to protect her boyfriend, Judd said: “This is one mean woman. She’s not cooperating, she’s not talking, she becomes incensed at the detectives as they’re trying to spell her last name right.” The suspects disposed of the gun and immediately drove to a McDonald’s restaurant in Lake Wales, where they ordered 10 double cheeseburgers and two McChicken sandwiches at the drive-thru, Judd said. William Wiggins later cleaned the outside of the truck, covered in red mud, after a relative they had borrowed it from complained. They had told her they were going to use it for a trip to Sebring or Avon Park. Investigators found blood inside the truck where Tony Wiggins had been sitting. Tony Wiggins has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder, tampering with evidence, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon. William Wiggins is charged with tampering with evidence and both he and Whittemore are charged with accessory after the fact. William Wiggins has one prior misdemeanor arrest and Whittemore none, Judd said. All three are scheduled for a first appearance hearing at 1 p.m. Thursday."
sheriff arrested,https://www.chron.com/news/article/At-88-former-Sheriff-Joe-Arpaio-makes-2nd-15432124.php,"At 88, former Sheriff Joe Arpaio makes 2nd comeback bid","PHOENIX (AP) — Joe Arpaio is trying to win back the sheriff’s post in metro Phoenix that he held for 24 years, facing his former second-in-command in the Aug. 4 Republican primary in what has become his second comeback bid. The 88-year-old lawman, who was unseated in the 2016 sheriff’s race by a Democratic challenger and was trounced in a 2018 U.S. Senate race, has based much of his campaign around his support for President Donald Trump. He has vowed to bring back things that the courts have either deemed illegal or his successor has done away with — immigration crackdowns, a complex of jail tents and other now-discarded trademarks. “I’m telling you right now: I am going to do 90% of what I did during my 24 years,” Arpaio said. “That’s the way it’s going to be.” Arpaio and his former second-in-command, Jerry Sheridan, are considered front-runners in GOP primary. Glendale Officer Mike Crawford and Mesa security guard Lehland Burton also are seeking the Republican nomination. The winner will go to face Democrat Paul Penzone, who crushed Arpaio in 2016 and is running unopposed in his primary. Arpaio and Sheridan were forced out of the agency amid heavy criticism for being found in civil contempt of court for disobeying a judge’s order 2011 to stop Arpaio’s traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. Arpaio said he’s out to prove his 2016 defeat was a fluke. But he has far less campaign money than he used to have and acknowledges some voters don’t even know he’s on the ballot this year. Sheridan, who said Arpaio backed out a promise to support him, said his 38 years in law enforcement could help turn around a tarnished agency and insisted that he is his own man. “I would argue with him when I disagreed with him,” Sheridan said. “A lot of the time he would listen to what I said. Other times he would brush me off. I am not Joe Arpaio.” Mike O’Neil, a longtime Arizona pollster who has followed Arpaio’s career, believes general election voters would vote down Arpaio. But he said it’s an open question whether primary voters — his most faithful supporters — would reject him. “In a Republican primary, it’s anybody’s guess,” O’Neil said. Over the last seven years, the sheriff’s office has been undergoing a court-ordered overhaul after a judge ruled sheriff’s deputies had racially profiled Latinos in Arpaio’s immigration patrols. The civil contempt findings against Arpaio and Sheridan were made in the profiling case. Arpaio was later convicted of criminal contempt for defying the order, but he was spared a possible jail sentence when Trump pardoned him. Sheridan wasn’t charged with criminal contempt. Arpaio and Sheridan vigorously dispute the contempt findings. Sheridan said he was unaware of the highly publicized court order and didn’t run the unit that carried out the immigration patrols. Taxpayer costs from the case are projected to reach $178 million by next summer. No one in county government can say when the spending will subside or end. A report on the agency’s traffic enforcement said stops of Hispanic and Black drivers in 2019 were more likely to last longer and result in searches than those of white drivers. Penzone declined to an interview request. Crawford, a 28-year police veteran who works as a patrol officer, said the scandals stemming from the profiling case drove him to run. “We definitely need to get rid of those types of behavior in law enforcement,” he said. Burton, a write-in candidate who hasn’t worked in law enforcement, said the agency’s biggest challenge is its biased treatment of Blacks and Hispanics. Burton said he can speak credibly to those who have been discriminated against because he’s an outsider to police culture and, as a Black man, has been hassled and mistreated by officers in the past. Arpaio’s political liabilities have been piling up for years: $147 million in taxpayer-funded legal bills, a failure to investigate more than 400 sex-crimes complaints made to the office and launching criminal investigations against judges, politicians and others who were at odds with him. His first political comeback attempt ended badly when he placed third in a 2018 U.S. Senate primary, even losing his adopted hometown of Fountain Hills. Though Arpaio is leading among sheriff’s candidates in fundraising with $1.2 million — most of his donations came from other states — the total pales in comparison to the $10 million he raised at this point in 2016. Arpaio said he remains mentally sharp and physically healthy. If he were to win and serve the full four years, he would finish that term six months before his 93rd birthday. He is quick to point out that 77-year-old former Vice President Joe Biden and 87-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg continue to work as they are getting up in age. “No one is indispensable,” Arpaio said. “If I die in office, then you appoint someone else.”"

Edmondson said he and many of his classmates were stunned by the arrest, as well as the specific charges that Fleer is now facing.

        Wanted Man Arrested After Brief Stand-Off: Sheriff's Office      ","WAUKEGAN, IL — A man wanted on two Lake County warrants was arrested Friday following a brief stand-off with sheriff's deputies, police and a pair of dogs, authorities said. Cory Cooper, 22, faces felony robbery and theft charges stemming with a pair of December 2019 incidents, according to the Lake County sheriff's and clerk's offices. The sheriff's office's warrants team learned Cooper, a former Oak Park resident, had recently been living in the home of a family member in Waukegan, according to Sgt. Chris Covelli. Around 9 a.m., members of the team staking out the duplex spotted Cooper briefly step outside. When deputies walked up to the house, Cooper began to try to flee through a bathroom window, but he retreated when he said Waukegan police and additional deputies behind the home, according to Covelli. As deputies went inside, Cooper fled his side of the house and entered a second-story foyer leading to the other apartment in the subdivided single-family home. Covelli said he then proceeded to hide under some blankets. Once the sheriff's office's dogs, Dax and Duke, arrived and began to bark at him, Cooper gave up attempting to hide and surrendered, according to the spokesperson for the sheriff's office. In the first of his two pending criminal cases in the county, Cooper is accused of stealing a pair of shoes from a minor on Dec. 12, 2019, in Waukegan, according to the sheriff's office. The second warrant was issued in February in connection with a Dec. 19, 2019, robbery in Mundelein. No further information about the charge was immediately available from Mundelein police. Cooper also picked up a new charge of resisting arrest in connection with Friday morning's ordeal and held at Lake County Jail ahead of an initial court hearing. Prior to the new charge, Cooper would have had to post $11,000 in cash to secure his pretrial release. Court records show Cooper pleaded guilty in April 2019 to a charge of pointing a gun at a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin two years earlier. And in September 2019 he pleaded guilty to felony shoplifting in McHenry County. Covelli said the second conviction aggravated the latest theft charge to a felony."

The store clerk later told investigators the suspects were in the store and overheard Tillman saying he was meeting up with his friends. Judd said Tony Wiggins told his brother to drive to the lake. Once there, Tony Wiggins confronted Springfield, accusing him of stealing his truck and selling the engine. Judd said investigators have not yet determined whether that allegation is true. The brother told detectives Tony Wiggins shot all three victims, then asked him to help put Tillman in the back of a truck.

In an interview on ""The Daily Briefing,"" Judd explained that 26-year-old Tony ""TJ"" Wiggins had 230 felony charges already under his belt.

Judd said the killings seemed to stem from an argument over the elder Wiggins' truck. Investigators said Tillman apparently arrived at the lake first to meet his friends. When Rollins and Springfield arrived, they saw their friend being beaten. The attackers then turned on them and began shooting. Rollins was still alive when the attackers left and called his father for help. His father rushed to the fishing spot about 10 minutes away but forgot his cellphone in the hurry to help his son. He drove to a nearby convenience store, and the clerk helped him call the cops but, by the time they arrived, Rollins had died. The other two men died shortly afterward.

There was an intense manhunt for the killers and a reward for information leading to an arrest in the case had already ballooned to $30,000. TJ Wiggins had been arrested in March for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was released on bond.

FROSTPROOF — Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said detectives have arrested two men and a woman responsible for the fatal shootings of three friends found dead while they were headed to a fishing trip near Frostproof on Friday night. At a news conference Wednesday, Judd identified the suspects as Tony “T.J.” Wiggins, 26; his girlfriend Mary Whittemore, 27; and Wiggins’ brother William “Robert” Wiggins, 21. Among the leads that drew detectives to the suspects were hundreds of tips to the Heartland Crime Stoppers line. “‘Look at T.J. Wiggins from Frostproof,‘” Judd quoted some of the callers saying. “Not because they had any idea he did it, just because he’s mean.” Tony Wiggins was first arrested at age 12 and has a history of 230 felony charges including battery and weapons charges, Judd said. He has been convicted 15 times and served two terms in state prison, Judd said. “He’s wild and he’s out of control.” A video recording shows that the fatal encounter apparently began when the victims and suspects ran into each other Friday night at a nearby Dollar General Store, Judd said. In describing the shooting scene, the sheriff said T.J. Wiggins screamed at one of the victims, “You stole the engine out of my truck.” “The only evidence we have,” Judd said, “is that T.J.is mad over some kind of truck deal that happened a long time ago.” All the suspects and victims are from the Lake Wales and Frostproof area. The victims were beaten and shot to death as they were heading to Lake Streety near Frostproof to go fishing, Judd said. They are Damion Tillman, 23, Keven Springfield, 30, and Brandon Rollins, 27. “What’s messed up is that Keven and Tony knew each other,” said Keri Black, a longtime friend of victims Brandon Rollins and Keven Springfield and the mother of five of Springfield’s eight children. “They all knew each other. They grew up together.” “T.J.” Wiggins was a familiar face at local hangouts in Frostproof. He wasn’t a close friend of the three victims, but he wasn’t an enemy either, Black told the Times on Wednesday. No one was, she said. “All three of them shared a really, really gentle soul,” Black said. “Keven would do anything and everything for anybody, without question. He was loving and kind to everyone he ever met.” Tony Wiggins ran into victim Tillman in line at the Dollar General Store 9:56 p.m. Friday as Tillman was buying supplies for the fishing trip. Wiggins learned through a clerk at the store that Springfield was going on the trip, too. Wiggins and the other two suspects followed Tillman out of the store. Ten minutes later, a fatally wounded Rollins placed a frantic cell phone call to his father, saying only, “Help.” Investigators soon identified the three suspects, and on Monday, located them “off the grid” in a wooded family compound of camper trailers, Judd said. Investigators found two shotguns and two rifles in a gun safe at Wiggins’ trailer and arrested him. He was out on bail at the time, following an arrest in March on charges including aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Investigators also located a single shell casing from a 9 mm pistol in Wiggins’ trailer that matched the Smith & Wesson handgun used in the shootings. William Wiggins and Whittemore agreed to be interviewed by detectives. Whittemore admitted buying ammunition before the shooting then stopped cooperating. William Wiggins provided more details. Detectives learned that the suspects had no plans to go to the lake until Tony Wiggins decided to follow Tillman. William Wiggins was driving a pickup truck carrying the suspects when they pulled up to find the three friends parked side by side in two pickups on Lake Streety Road. They were talking to one another, Tillman in his truck and Springfield at the wheel of other with Rollins in Springfield’s passenger seat. Tony Wiggins and Tillman got out of their trucks. Wiggins pulled a handgun and pushed Tillman, yelling, “Where’s Keven?” Wiggins spotted Springfield sitting in the truck, ran toward and him and pointed the gun at him, demanding, “Where’s my truck? You sold the engine out of my truck.” Springfield, who worked as an auto tech, replied that he didn’t know what Wiggins was talking about. Wiggins struck Springfield. Tillman screamed repeatedly from the other truck, “Put the gun away!” “T.J.‘s out of control screaming, ‘Where’s my truck,’ and he starts shooting Keven and Brandon inside the white truck,” Judd said. The two were hit about nine or 10 times. Wiggins then shot Tillman several times as Tillman sat in his truck, he said. William Wiggins said he was not involved in the shootings but afterward, helped lift Tillman and place him in the back of one of the pickups, Judd said. Whittemore declined to talk to investigators about the incident and lied to protect her boyfriend, Judd said: “This is one mean woman. She’s not cooperating, she’s not talking, she becomes incensed at the detectives as they’re trying to spell her last name right.” The suspects disposed of the gun and immediately drove to a McDonald’s restaurant in Lake Wales, where they ordered 10 double cheeseburgers and two McChicken sandwiches at the drive-thru, Judd said. William Wiggins later cleaned the outside of the truck, covered in red mud, after a relative they had borrowed it from complained. They had told her they were going to use it for a trip to Sebring or Avon Park. Investigators found blood inside the truck where Tony Wiggins had been sitting. Tony Wiggins has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder, tampering with evidence, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.

deputy fired,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/can-feds-legally-fire-tear-gas-sweep-people-off-portland-streets/ar-BB17bmdO,"Can feds legally fire tear gas, sweep people off Portland streets?","Heavily armed men in camouflage fatigues advancing in a skirmish line along downtown Portland’s Main Street at 2 a.m., firing tear gas at fleeing crowds. Federal officers clearing out nearby Lownsdale Square, yanking shields from some people and striking others with batons. Uniformed government agents pulling at least two people into unmarked vans off city streets for questioning. All with no city police in view and at least a block away from the federal courthouse that President Donald Trump and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad F. Wolf said they sent 114 federal officers to protect. The aggressive response to protests against police brutality and racial injustice that devolve into violence late at night has brought widespread condemnation from city and state leaders, civil rights authorities and thousands of residents who have converged at the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse to protest the federal fortification. An overarching question has increasingly accompanied the images of the nightly confrontations: Can the federal officers do all that, considering public safety is reserved as a state police power under the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution? The short answer? Yes, but arguably not as far as they have gone. The longer answer is steeped in federal and state law and foundational principles that built the nation. Wolf said this week that the federal forces – including the Federal Protective Service, Border Patrol and deputy marshals -- are acting under federal law “that’s been on the books for decades.” It’s designed to protect federal property and allow officers to make arrests accordingly. He cited a section of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that gives the department’s secretary the power to deputize other federal agents to help the Federal Protective Service safeguard U.S. government buildings such as the federal courthouse in Portland. Those officers, under the law, may “carry firearms ... conduct investigations on or off the property in question ... and make arrests without a warrant for any offense against the United States” if they have “reasonable grounds to believe the person to be arrested has committed a felony.” Oregon state law also authorizes federal officers to make arrests for any offense they witness, whether it’s on state or federal property and whether it would lead to state or federal charges. Billy Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Oregon, has said the federal response had been conservative until the front glass doors of the courthouse were broken. The approach shifted, he said, because, “We can’t have people entering the federal courthouse hellbent on destruction.” But constitutional experts and critics of the federal mission called “Operation Diligent Valor” believe the federal officers in Portland have gone well beyond their stated security duty. Even if the federal agencies have legitimate license to defend the courthouse, “The real question is: Is it being used as a pretext?” said Ryan Goodman, a professor at New York University School of Law. “They can use a technical legal authority to allow them to at least get the federal forces on the ground with the hidden agenda to get the most expansive use of them,” Goodman told The Oregonian/OregonLive. With the Trump administration undeterred by calls from Gov. Kate Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler to remove the federal forces, local and state attorneys have turned to the courts. Oregon’s attorney general, the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, state legislators and other lawyers have filed at least four lawsuits against the federal agencies in the last week. The court fights are important but remain an uphill battle to prove the government is exceeding its authority to enforce federal law, legal experts said. It likely will be easier to prove specific instances where federal officers have violated an individual’s right to due process or freedom of assembly or if the officers have used excessive force or made an unlawful seizure, lawyers said. Others are calling for more drastic steps, urging Oregon police to arrest federal officers on state or federal crimes, ranging from assault to racketeering conspiracy. “This is an extraordinary situation where you have federal officers being deployed into a municipality without coordination or request from that municipality,” said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, a constitutional rights attorney and co-founder of Partnership for Civil Justice Fund based in Washington, D.C. “The issue here,” she said, “really goes to what the different government authorities inside Portland and Oregon are willing to do. …There’s a lot of press conferences and requests to leave, but Oregon has criminal arrest authority for federal law enforcement committing crimes on their streets.” U.S. Attorney General William Barr has been working to use federal forces “against an unwilling state” for decades, Goodman said in an article he wrote recently for the publication he edits, JustSecurity. He referenced statements Barr made in a 2001 interview as he explained his strategy for sending in federal officers to address unrest in the Virgin Islands after a major hurricane in 1989. Barr was then an assistant attorney general. “We looked at some statutes, and we finally decided that without Presidential authority we could send down law enforcement people to defend the federal function,” Barr said, according to a transcript of his interview. The justification included keeping courts open and dealing with civil unrest, Barr said. “We said, People are interfering with the operation of our courts and so on. I said, ‘we can send people down to defend the federal function, keep our courts open, and if they see any crime being committed in front of them, then, as law enforcement officers, they can make the arrest.‘ ” “Our object was just to get federal law enforcement down there and play it by ear,” he said. Goodman and Elizabeth Goiten, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, both believe Barr is using the same approach to send in federal officers as a show of force in Portland at a time when Portland’s own police face court orders and local and state restrictions on their use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions. “Federal law enforcement agents are always operating in the states and generally it’s not a problem,‘' Goiten said. “What’s unusual in Portland is that they are coming in on the pretext of enforcing federal law, and while they say they’re protecting federal property, they are wreaking havoc and actually escalating the violence and danger and making it worse.” Andrew Warden, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice, has defended what the federal officers are doing in Portland, arguing in court this week that “when public safety and government property is threatened by violent opportunists, government can take lawful steps to disperse.” Federal officials estimate the cost to repair damage at the courthouse so far exceeds $50,000 -- including cleaning up graffiti and replacing shattered glass doors. They’ve said 28 federal officers have been injured from thrown objects, including commercial fireworks and glass bottles. Meanwhile, a judge dealt the state a blow Friday, denying a restraining order that would have barred federal officers from plucking people off city streets to question or arrest. The judge found the state lacked standing and presented scant evidence to support its case. Goodman said he can’t think of a precedent that has allowed states to stop this kind of federal action. Still, he said, “These are such unprecedented actions that maybe the courts would engage in landmark decisions that rethink what the law is or should be.” One other way would be for Congress to withhold funding from federal law enforcement agencies, he said. Oregon’s U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both Democrats, signed a letter Friday to members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, urging them not to fund any Justice Department or Homeland Security personnel, programs or activities that infringe on the constitutional rights to free assembly and peaceful protest. Officers from the Federal Protective Service, U.S. Marshals Service Special Operations Group and a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol tactical unit have gone beyond the federal courthouse to use force against demonstrators. Norm Stamper, who retired as Seattle police chief in 2000 and has written two books on policing. The federal agents have essentially pre-empted Portland police, he said. “They have a right to investigate a crime against federal property or federal officers, but they went out as a riot control, crowd control force,” Stamper said. “They’ve fired tear gas indiscriminately. They’re engaged in what is supposed to be domestic policing.” U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon on Thursday issued a 14-day order barring federal officers from targeting journalists or legal observers and said in court that he was disturbed by several images of federal officers using force against nonaggressive demonstrators. He spoke of the July 18 baton-beating of 53-year-old Navy veteran Chris David who tried to talk with federal officers outside the courthouse and an impact munition that hit 26-year-old Donavan La Bella in the forehead as he stood across the street from the courthouse on July 11. According to Marshals Service policy, its officers may use less-lethal or impact munitions to protect themselves or others or make an arrest. They can’t use impact munitions “if voice commands or physical control achieve the law enforcement objective.” And, they must stop firing impact munitions “once they are no longer needed to achieve its law enforcement purpose,” and not to “punish, harass, taunt, or abuse a subject.‘’ Steven Wax, who led Oregon’s Federal Public Defender Office before he retired in 2014, has called on Oregon’s U.S. attorney and the Multnomah County district attorney to convene grand juries with subpoena powers to investigate alleged criminal acts by federal officers. Potential charges could include kidnapping, assault and racketeering conspiracy, he said. “Use of a grand jury would provide a vehicle for investigation into what happened far more rapidly than a civil suit,‘' he said. While federal watchdogs have pledged to investigate the shooting of La Bella, the baton barrage on David and the seizure of Mark Pettibone off a city street without facing charges, Wax said it’s not sufficient “to allow the fox to investigate the deaths of the chickens in the henhouse.” Attorney Steve Kanter, dean emeritus of Lewis & Clark Law School, said Portland and the nation are at a crucial tipping point. “Constitutional democracies are fragile,” Kanter said. “If people don’t stand up to insist on rule of law and justice, wherever it falls, you’re going to wake up in a few years and you’re not going to be in the same country. “This is the time when people have to stand up. It’s the reason people become lawyers. The real reason we have a legal system.” Email at mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212 Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories. ©2020 The Oregonian (Portland, Ore.)

A Bexar County Sheriff's deputy was fired and arrested Tuesday in connection with the brutal beating of an inmate inside the Bexar County Jail. The former deputy, identified as 33-year-old Jean Camacho-Morales, is also accused of record tempering. Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar speaks to reporters about the arrest of former deputy Jean Camacho-Morales Tuesday night. At around 4 p.m. Monday, Camacho-Morales said he found the 44-year-old inmate brutally beaten in the shower of one of the living units and immediately called for assistance. However, Sheriff Javier Salazar said surveillance footage contradicts Camcho-Morales' version of the events. Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar speaks to reporters about the arrest of former deputy Jean Camacho-Morales Tuesday night. According to Salazar, the deputy instead waited before helping the inmate and had prior knowledge of the attack. Camacho-Morales allegedly turned off the lights in the shower unit in an attempt to conceal the crime from the jail's cameras and stood by as the victim was beaten by at least six other inmates, Salazar said. Salazar said the former deputy then left the man ""to lay in a pool of his own blood for 30 minutes while the other inmates had time to clean up and destroy evidence"" and then misled investigators by naming inmates who were helping the victim as suspects. ""He stood by and did nothing which is infuriating,"" the sheriff said ""We have deputies coming to work every day during pandemic and doing their job and working long, long OT hours and put health at risk and we have people like this. I take this to be a personal affront to everyone who wears this uniform."" The victim was rushed to the hospital with several facial fractures, damaged vertebras and was unable to breath on his own. ""This is the kind of misconduct our country is reeling against today,"" Salazar said, describing Camacho-Morales's actions as egregious. ""People like this is why millions of dollars in property damage has occurred around the country because of rioting and misconduct, because of people like him."" Salazar said the BCSO Public Integrity Unit, Internal Affairs and local FBI are investigating. The sheriff said investigators are unsure if the incident was gang-related and how the former deputy is connected to the inmates. Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar speaks to reporters about the arrest of former deputy Jean Camacho-Morales Tuesday night. An inmate has also been charged in connection with the incident.

A Fort Bend County deputy has been charged in connection with the May fatal shooting of Fort Bend County Precinct 4 Deputy Constable Caleb Rule and has been fired, according to a news release issued by the sheriff’s office on Wednesday. Deputy Chadwick McRae was indicted on Monday by the Fort Bend County grand jury for criminal negligent homicide. According to the indictment, McRae shot without first “visually checking the area where he was firing. ” It goes on to say that he fired in response to “an auditory stimulus” without looking to locate the source of the sound.

In May, Rule and three sheriff’s deputies responded to a report of suspicious activity about 1:45 a.m. at a house in the 3900 block of Chestnut Bend in Sienna Plantation, a master-planned community located about 12 miles southeast of Sugar Land’s town square. The deputies and Rule, with Precinct 4, apparently arrived at the residence around the same time. The law enforcement officers noticed a back door was not secured and entered. As they were clearing the home, adeputy discharged his weapon, believing a suspect was inside, officials said. The gunfire struck Rule. The 37-year-old officer was flown to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where he later died. Rule was a married father of four who had served 14 years with the Missouri City Police Department.

A sergeant with the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office in Tampa, Fla., has been fired and charged with assault after he pointed a gun at an unarmed man for refusing to give his name, the sheriff said. The man was on the ground and in police custody at the time, Sheriff Chad Chronister said at a news conference on Friday. Deputies who witnessed the incident reported Sgt. Janak Amin’s “egregious action” to supervisors. Sergeant Amin, who had been with the sheriff’s office for 21 years, was fired and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Sheriff Chronister said. He was released after posting a $2,000 bond, the sheriff said. “Sergeant Amin’s actions, the violation of public trust and dishonoring of his oath to serve and protect is despicable,” Sheriff Chronister said. The victim, a Black man whose name the authorities said they would not disclose, had been accidentally released from jail and was taken to a substance abuse and mental health treatment center, Sheriff Chronister said. The man left the treatment center on Thursday morning, and deputies found him hiding behind a trailer in North Tampa, the sheriff said. The man was taken into custody, and the sheriff’s deputies placed him on the ground, chest down, as they attempted to identify him, the sheriff said. The man refused to confirm his identity, and Sergeant Amin drew his gun, pointed it at the man’s head and threatened his life, the sheriff said. The victim was not armed and “made no aggressive actions,” Sheriff Chronister said. The man “was in fear for his life,” the sheriff said, and has been cooperating with the authorities. “Even though the victim of this crime is an arrestee, he is entitled to the same protections and rights of any victim of a crime,” Sheriff Chronister said. A Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman said in a statement that race was not a factor in the episode. The authorities were unable to locate video footage of the encounter, and the spokeswoman said the deputies were not wearing body cameras. Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies do not currently wear body cameras but will be doing so “in the near future,” the spokeswoman said. The dismissal of Sergeant Amin comes as police departments across the nation are being urged to revamp or adopt “duty to intervene” policies in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. Such policies require officers to intervene if they see a colleague endangering a member of the public. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office has had a similar “duty to act” policy since 2007, the spokeswoman said. Deputies are required to report when they see a fellow deputy using unreasonable or excessive force, and to intervene to de-escalate the situation, according to department guidelines. “We respect, we demand that our deputies uphold the highest level of professionalism,” Sheriff Chronister said at the news conference. “And that means intervening when another law enforcement officer, even a supervisor, betrays the public trust and theirs.” In 2007, Sergeant Amin and another deputy were investigated after they were involved in the fatal shooting of a 45-year-old former firefighter who pointed a shotgun at them after he emerged from a mobile home where he had barricaded himself, according to news reports. The State Attorney for the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, which includes Hillsborough County, investigated and found the shooting to be justified, according to an Internal Affairs report released by the Sheriff’s Office. Sergeant Amin could not be reached for comment. The Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman said that he was being represented by a lawyer, but that she did not know the lawyer’s name. “There is no question, this incident is detestable and not representative of who we are as a law enforcement agency,” Sheriff Chronister said."

The recommendations include the adoption of an affirmative-action plan to make the police force more “representative of the community it serves,” along with residency requirements for department leaders and incentives for rank-and-file officers to live in Prince George’s. The groups also recommended greater accountability in internal-affairs investigations and additional training around discrimination, retaliation, harassment and implicit bias. The ideas were sent in a letter to the members of the county’s task force on police reform. County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) created the task force this month as Prince George’s battles allegations of discrimination within the police department and amid nationwide calls for police reform after George Floyd was killed in the custody of Minneapolis officers. The two groups recommending the 12-point plan are the United Black Police Officers Association (UBPOA) and the Hispanic National Law Enforcement Association (HNLEA), whose members sued the county in 2018 alleging workplace discrimination. The lawsuit — which asserts the police department disproportionately disciplines minority officers — has not been resolved. “I know that we can do better for both the citizens of Prince George’s County and the officers that work for Prince George’s,” Joe Perez, the president of HNLEA and a former a former officer with the department, said in a news conference Thursday. Perez is a plaintiff in the lawsuit alongside about a dozen officers. They are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland and the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. Prince George’s County Circuit Court Judge Maureen Lamasney and state Del. Alonzo T. Washington (D-Prince George’s) were asked to lead the county’s task force and present a report to Alsobrooks by Oct. 30. Washington said the task force will review and consider the recommendations from all community members who submit ideas ahead of the October deadline. The task force had a public listening session scheduled for Thursday evening. The police associations submitted their recommendations in a 10-page letter signed by Perez and UBPOA President Thomas Boone, who is a lieutenant in the department and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The letter calls for the department to eliminate what they call a culture of retaliation against officers who “object to racist statements, racist conduct, and discrimination by white officers.” It also calls for the department to adopt an officer-bystander intervention program that encourages members of the department to step in if they witness wrongdoing by a colleague. “You have to earn respect within your community, and the way you earn respect is showing them you will be a part of the community. . . . You build a police force that wants to learn from their mistakes,” Lt. Sonya Zollicoffer, second vice president of the UBPOA, said in the news conference. “You have to fix within before you can fix outside the department.” The department has said in the past that it works with the Prince George’s County state’s attorney’s office to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, including some ­cases in which officers report other police officers. The associations also urged the department to overhaul how it monitors civilian complaints to look for instances or patterns of racial profiling. Two full sections of the letter include recommendations to address implicit bias in internal-affairs investigations or disciplinary decisions, along with suggestions on revamping the process for filing equal-employment complaints. The final recommendation suggests creating a chief compliance officer ranked higher than the deputy chiefs to head a new “Office of Compliance.” That position’s sole responsibility, the groups said, should be to implement reform recommendations.

police sued,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/settlement-offered-to-latino-ann-arbor-police-officer-to-drop-federal-discrimination-lawsuit/ar-BB1740fW,Settlement offered to Latino Ann Arbor Police officer to drop federal discrimination lawsuit,"ANN ARBOR, MI – A federal discrimination lawsuit filed by a Latino Ann Arbor Police officer two years ago could end soon after a vote passed at Monday’s City Council meeting. The Ann Arbor City Council voted 10-1 July 20 to approve a settlement offer to Ann Arbor Police Sgt. Mauro Cervantes who filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the city and the department in late 2018. Cervantes, an officer in the department for 32 years, filed a federal lawsuit Dec. 14, 2018, accusing the department of ethnic discrimination and disability discrimination for not accommodating a sleep disorder. The lawsuit claims the department retaliated against the sergeant by promoting white officers ahead of him despite his superior performance and test results. The city council approved an offer of $8,500 and a credit of 104 hours compensatory time for Cervantes, contingent with him dropping the lawsuit and the court dismissing all claims with prejudice. Ahead of the vote, City Attorney Stephen Postema advised council members passing the resolution was “a minimal settlement to end federal litigation.” Jeff Hayner, D-1st Ward, cast the only dissenting vote against the offer, stating he was morally opposed to voting for it. “I’m certain that it’s the right thing to do to pass this on, but I’m morally opposed to voting for it, so I’m voting no,” he said during Monday’s meeting. It is unclear if the offer has been accepted as Cervantes’ attorney, Leonard Mungo, could not be reached for comment. Cervantes, in his lawsuit, claims he asked his superiors several times for alternate shift times to accommodate his sleep disorder, but each request was denied. Despite finishing first and second in lieutenant promotion tests in 2016 and 2017, respectively, Cervantes was passed up for promotion by four white sergeants, according to the lawsuit. He noted that none of the people promoted ahead of him suffered from a disability, and that he was unfairly punished for his condition. Cervantes was “qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation,” the court complaint states. The case remains open, but no future court dates are listed. Former small business owner challenges incumbent for Ann Arbor’s state rep. seat ©2020 MLive.com, Walker, Mich.

police sued,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/07/24/rubber-bullets-less-lethal-weapons-victims-police-protesters-decades/5410519002/,"Police use of rubber bullets, bean bag rounds has left a bloody trail for decades. Those maimed say enough is enough.","There’s a gap in Scott Olsen’s memory for the night of Oct. 25, 2011. The Iraq War vet remembers leaving his tech job in the San Francisco Bay Area and taking a BART train to join an Occupy Oakland protest against economic and social inequality. He remembers standing near protesters who faced off with Oakland police officers bristling with riot gear. He remembers being carried away by other protesters. But not the moment when a “bean bag” round fired from an officer’s 12-gauge shotgun crashed into the left side of his head, fracturing his skull and inflicting a near-fatal brain injury that forced him to relearn how to talk. What happened to Olsen was not unique or isolated. Time and again over the past two decades – from L.A. to D.C., Minneapolis to Miami – peace officers have targeted civilian demonstrators with munitions designed to stun and stop, rather than kill. As many as 60 protesters suffered head wounds during Black Lives Matter events, including bone fractures, blindness and traumatic brain injuries. Activists and civil libertarians worldwide have urged police to ban less lethal projectiles from use for crowd control. Law enforcement in the United Kingdom ceased using them that way decades ago. But an investigation by USA TODAY and Kaiser Health News found little has changed over the years in the United States. Beyond the Constitution and federal court rulings that require police use of force to be “reasonable,” there are no national rules for discharging bean bags and rubber bullets. Nor are there standards for the weapons’ velocity, accuracy or safety. Congress and state legislatures have done little to offer solutions. While locations and demonstration types vary, a pattern has emerged: Shooting victims file lawsuits; cities pay out millions of dollars; police departments try to adopt reforms. And, a few years later, it happens again. Law enforcement officers, typically with limited training, are bound only by departmental policies that vary from one agency to the next. Sometimes referred to as kinetic impact projectiles, less lethal ammunition includes bean bags (nylon sacks filled with lead shot), so-called rubber bullets that actually are tipped with foam or sponge and paintball-like rounds containing chemical irritants. Velocity and range vary greatly, but they can travel upwards of 200 mph. The rounds were developed to save lives by giving police a knock-down option that can disable threats from a safe distance without killing the target. The past two months have been especially telling, with dozens maimed or hurt amid Black Lives Matter demonstrations: Photographer Linda Tirado, 37, lost an eye after being hit by a foam projectile in Minneapolis. Brandon Saenz, 26, lost an eye and several teeth after being hit with a “sponge round” in Dallas. Leslie Furcron, 59, was placed in a medically induced coma after she was shot between the eyes with a “bean bag” round in La Mesa, California. And, in Portland, Oregon, 26-year-old Donavan La Bella suffered facial and skull fractures when he was shot by a federal officer with a less lethal round. “Nothing has changed,” said attorney Elizabeth Ritter, 59, one of several people shot in the head by an impact munition at a 2003 protest in Miami. A video later surfaced showing police supervisors laughing about her shooting. “It’s fairly sickening to me. We have a systemic, deeply ingrained problem.” From a law enforcement perspective, less lethal weapons are essential tools in a continuum of force.  A sponge-tipped round or a pouch full of pellets can stop a violent act without putting the officer in peril – and without killing the suspect. Police leaders typically condemn the indiscriminate firing into peaceful crowds but characterize such incidents as conduct violations rather than weaponry problems. Steve Ijames, a retired officer who developed programs for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, blames “boneheaded policemen’’ and a training gap for the misuse of arms. Law enforcement instruction focuses almost entirely on how to use less lethal force against individual suspects, Ijames noted, and not on crowd-control scenarios that occur only sporadically. Still, when demonstrations morph into disturbances, less lethal devices are often dusted off and pressed into duty. “What is the alternative?” asked Sid Heal, a retired commander from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department who has extensively studied the munitions. “We’re stuck with the tools we have. And if you take one away, we’re going to have to go to something else, and it will probably be harsher.” The National Institute of Justice spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on initiatives to collect data and start developing national standards for less lethal weapon safety after the Boston student’s death in 2004. Funding dried up after a few years, and the efforts died. Against that backdrop, Congress has shown little interest in regulating bean bags and rubber bullets. And national law enforcement leadership groups have repeatedly punted when given an opportunity. After the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2014, 2015 and 2017 would have banned state and local law enforcement from using key federal grant dollars for less lethal weapons. The measure never made it out of committee. In 2017, a coalition of law enforcement groups representing police leaders and unions, which gathered to study use of force, published a consensus policy and discussion paper. The groups advocated a ban on police use of martial arts weapons – but did not extend it to less lethal munitions. A White House task force established after the Ferguson protests recommended “annual training” but little more for less lethal weapons. In June, 13 U.S. Senate Democrats asked the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to investigate the alleged misuses of rubber bullets and bean bags against Black Lives Matter demonstrations. “Although intended to only cause minimal harm, such weapons may cause significant injury,” the senators wrote. “Better information is needed to identify deficiencies in the training and use of these less lethal weapons ...” The Justice Department’s inspector general has launched an investigation of federal officers’ response to protest activity in Portland and Washington, D.C., the watchdog announced Thursday. Leaders of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Oversight committees this month had asked the office to review federal officers’ “violent tactics” used against protesters in those cities and elsewhere. And in California, several Democrat legislators introduced a measure in June that would ban the police use of less lethal munitions to disperse demonstrators. Except in riot conditions, the proposed law says, kinetic energy projectiles “shall not be used by any law enforcement agency against an assembly protected by the First Amendment.” Charles Mesloh, a former police officer, certified instructor and longtime researcher on less lethal weapons, said the status quo is “unacceptable,” but he sees little chance that national standards will be imposed for training, weapon safety and use. “I’ve been doing this long enough, I just – we’re just in a circle,” Mesloh said. “We’ll have some lip service ... and there'll be some mandated training, and then we’ll just go right back to where we were.” Carol Sobel, a Los Angeles civil rights attorney, keeps an unusual photo on her desk. It shows her with a goose-egg wound to her forehead and two black eyes. What’s not visible in the picture is the concussion, sinus fracture and more than six months of headaches. That’s the impact of a police projectile that struck her between the eyes as she stood outside the 2000 Democratic National Convention with a mainly peaceful crowd. ""My head snapped back and it hurt,"" she said. ""It was inconceivable to me that someone would shoot me in the face."" Over the past two decades, Los Angeles police have repeatedly used less lethal firepower on demonstrators, injuring hundreds and generating lawsuits that Sobel helped prosecute. Los Angeles police turned to bean bags as an alternative to live ammo after 1992 rioting triggered by the acquittal of officers who beat a Black man named Rodney King. As violence swept the city, police at first hunkered down, doing little to maintain order, then launched an aggressive crackdown. Ten people were killed by officers. In the aftermath, the department was criticized simultaneously for brutality and for failure to defend the community. Bean bag rounds and later 40mm projectiles emerged as options that were supposed to allow officers to protect themselves and the city without deaths or lawsuits. With the new arsenal, police in 2000 descended on protesters at MacArthur Park during the convention. Witnesses said demonstrators were shot in the back with rubber bullets as they tried to disperse. The city approved $4.1 million in payments to more than 90 people hurt during the melee. Among the shooting victims was Melissa Schneider, who secured a $1.4 million settlement after being blinded in one eye. Two decades later, Schneider said she still wakes up with excruciating pain where the eye used to be and frequently vomits as a result of migraines. Schneider said she was shaken watching internet videos of protesters injured in recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations:  “I immediately started sobbing – not for me, but for them and the journey they had ahead,” she said. “Things need to change. And it’s really sad. It’s been 20 years, and this is still happening.” Seven years after Schneider was maimed, Los Angeles police were back in MacArthur Park using batons, horses and less lethal rounds during a protest for immigrants' rights. More than 250 people were injured. An internal review determined projectiles were launched into crowds and at peaceful protesters. Although such weapons are supposed to be used to stop lawbreakers, no demonstrator was arrested. This time, city taxpayers forked out $13 million to settle civil complaints. The Police Department agreed to four years of court supervision, with rules banning the use of less lethal rounds against peaceful protesters. By 2015, amid a national controversy over police killings, Los Angeles police leaders were touting less lethal weapons as part of a kinder, gentler approach. The agency in 2017 adopted a progressive policy requiring officers to try de-escalation tactics before opening fire. But in May, when protests erupted after the death of George Floyd, police in Los Angeles unleashed bean bags and sponge rounds. A lawsuit filed by Black Lives Matter alleges “that the training of the LAPD in the use of these potentially lethal weapons was absent, seriously deficient, or intentionally indifferent to the known serious harm that can result.” The complaint, with Sobel as lead attorney, seeks an emergency ban on the use of less lethal arms for crowd control. Lawyers for the city argued a blanket ban would hamstring efforts to maintain law and order. Los Angeles police leaders declined to be interviewed for this article because it deals with personnel matters and issues that “will eventually be fleshed out in a complete, independent after-action report.” Sobel said she has seen it all before: “There is absolutely no institutional memory in the LAPD. That's No. 1. And No. 2 – they don't care."" Victoria Snelgrove leaned against a railing of a parking garage at Fenway Park, waiting for the crowd to dissipate so she could drive home from a raucous Red Sox celebration. Then Boston police fired the projectile that tore through her eye and into her brain. The home team had just defeated the New York Yankees to win the 2004 American League Championship. Sox fans rejoiced in the streets around the stadium. After some set fires and threw bottles, police began launching projectiles. Snelgrove, a 21-year-old college student and sports enthusiast who aspired to be an entertainment reporter on television, slipped into a coma. Her parents made the excruciating decision to remove life support hours later. The family collected $5 million in damages – reportedly the city’s largest settlement in history at the time. Snelgrove’s death spurred Boston police to convene a panel to figure out what went wrong. Among the commission findings: Boston had acquired its launchers less than a year earlier, without adequate understanding of safety issues. The manufacturer had suggested rounds would not break the skin. But a second protester had had a projectile lodged in his forehead, and a third suffered a gaping wound to the cheek. The commission said police needed more training on how to use less lethal weapons, particularly in crowd-control situations. It called for the National Institute of Justice to collect and disseminate comprehensive information on a burgeoning array of less lethal projectiles. And it urged the federal government to develop minimum safety standards with a testing program overseen by an independent agency such as the institute. Those recommendations were championed by Sen. Ted Kennedy, who said, ""The growing use and the false sense that they are completely safe are leading to the kind of avoidable tragedy that shocked all of us in Boston."" NIJ awarded grants to a Wayne State University researcher, Cynthia Bir, to help develop standards. Over several years, study groups were formed. Testing modes were developed. Then, according to Bir, Tasers and other equipment became more widely used by police. As interest in rubber bullets and bean bags waned, the Great Recession depleted funding. Research efforts dissolved along with prospects for standards for less lethal weapons. “NIJ gave us a fair amount of funding to look at this issue and then … the focus switched to Tasers,” Bir said. “Everything just kind of went away.” The NIJ did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment. Rick Wyant, a forensic scientist who served on an NIJ panel, said standards could be imposed by tying them to federal law enforcement grants. Otherwise, unregulated arms can continue putting the public at risk, he said. “I can go in my garage and develop something, and if I get a (police) chief to sign off on it and deploy it, that’s all that needs to happen,” Wyant said. U.S. law enforcement and defense agencies spend about $2.5 billion annually on less lethal weapons and ammunition, according to Anuj Mishra, an analyst with MarketsandMarkets, a research firm based in India. That's almost half the global total and includes sales of tear gas and Tasers as well as projectile weapons. Mishra said less lethal weapons sales have taken off with a proliferation of new products. More than a half-dozen companies supply U.S. police departments with plastic and rubber bullets, paintball-type rounds, launchers and less lethal projectiles fired from 12-gauge shotguns. Sales are driven by personal relationships, Internet advertising and trade shows where police try out the latest models on shooting ranges, industry executives say. “Cops are always looking for gadgets. They’re always looking for new technology,” said Eugene Paoline, professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida. “They like toys.” Less lethal weapons became part of a national conversation after the deadly 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager, in Ferguson, Missouri. As police agencies responded to protests with military-style tactics, criticism mounted from  medical, civil rights and activist groups that condemn the use of less lethal projectiles to break up demonstrations. Physicians for Human Rights, for example, contends that kinetic-impact bullets “are not an appropriate weapon to be used for crowd management, and specifically for dispersal purposes.” Rohini Haar, an emergency room physician and researcher at the University of California Berkeley, co-authored research in 2017 with Physicians for Human Rights on the damage inflicted by less lethal rounds. In a study of nearly 2,000 shooting victims, 3% died and 15% were permanently disabled. Haar’s takeaway: “Policing has to have a reckoning,” and that would include a ban on rubber bullets and more regulation of all less lethal weapons in crowd-control scenarios. By contrast, police and government inquiries after the Ferguson protests resulted in no clear guidelines for the use of plastic and bean bag rounds.  A task force created by President Obama, which urged federal investigations of inappropriate use of police equipment and tactics during demonstrations, recommended little more than “annual training.” Eleven of the nation’s top law enforcement leadership organizations in 2017 developed what they called a National Consensus Policy on Use of Force. The white paper lacks detailed direction for less lethal munitions while stressing that even vague guidance is “not intended to be a national standard by which all agencies are held accountable.” In the aftermath of George Floyd demonstrations, that report was updated earlier this month. But wording on less lethal weaponry remained the same: It urges police to ban martial arts weapons such as blackjacks and nunchucks, but avoids a recommendation on less lethal projectiles, leaving decisions to individual agencies. Terrence Cunningham, who took part in the review as president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said after inquiries for this story that he now supports a consensus policy for less lethal munitions. “We definitely need some kind of foundational standards,” said Cunningham, now the association’s deputy executive director. Meanwhile, the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit think tank, last year convened 225 police chiefs, officers, industry representatives and academics for yet another symposium on police use of force. The forum's 45-page report endorses less lethal arms as a sometimes controversial part of the law enforcement toolkit and emphasizes that the weapons ""often do not work as desired."" Law enforcement experts point out there are about 18,000 police forces in the United States, and it may be impossible to develop homogeneous standards or practices that work in communities ranging from New York City to Minooka, Illinois. “Most agencies in America are 50 people or less. They don’t have big budgets,” said Don Kester, head of training for the National Tactical Officer Association. “You write a (detailed) policy and all the chiefs say you’ve created an unfunded mandate” for equipment and training. The alternative – and the reality – is a system where each agency decides which weapons to use, what training to provide, and what policies to enforce. All operate on the same underlying function, as spelled out by Ed Obayashi, an attorney and deputy chief of California’s Plumas County Sheriff’s Office: “to inflict pain to gain compliance and to disperse a crowd.” If protesters ignore police instructions, he added, firing on the overall crowd could be justified depending on circumstances. Obayashi allowed that videos taken during recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations presented “bad optics” for less lethal weapons. But a full story can’t be presented from films, he said while asserting that the overall response by U.S. peace officers was “very controlled and did not cause a measurable number of serious injuries.” “When law enforcement gives an order to disperse, and that doesn’t happen, we don’t have a lot of options,” agreed Wade Carpenter, the police chief in Park City, Utah, who oversees IACP’s firearms and tactical committees. “Whenever we have individuals that are trying to incite these riots, there is a level of force that has to be used.” If Scott Olsen struggles to recall what happened when police shot him with a bean bag round, his sentiments about the Oakland Police Department are crystal clear: “I think bad things,” Olsen, now 33, said in a recent phone interview. The projectile that struck Olsen’s head in 2011 was launched despite previous, similar incidents that resulted in lawsuits, independent investigations, court orders and police reforms. James Chanin, an Oakland attorney who filed some of the civil actions, and won settlements, tells about a “long history of alleged civil rights violations” by the city’s police force. In April 2003, protesters against the Iraq War blocked a Port of Oakland entrance at a marine terminal. A lawsuit described how police moved to break up the demonstration, firing wooden dowels to skip them off the ground at protesters, shooting bean bag rounds into the crowd, and setting off stinger grenades that scattered chemical irritants and small balls. Sri Louise Coles, a lead plaintiff in one of the cases, alleged that she suffered face and neck wounds from a projectile and additional injuries when an officer rammed her with a motorcycle. In settling that case, Oakland agreed to new crowd-control and management policies. Less lethal munitions “shall not be used for crowd management, crowd control or crowd dispersal,” the policy instructed, and such devices “may never be used indiscriminately against a crowd or group of persons.” Eight years later, Olsen was near the front of an Occupy Oakland demonstration when police declared the gathering an illegal assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse. Officers then launched a fusillade of less lethal munitions, including the round that struck Olsen. As other protesters rushed to his aid, an Oakland police officer deployed a chemical canister into the group, an independent investigation commissioned by the city later found. Police said afterward that they did not see Olsen had been wounded, so they did not fulfill a mandatory requirement to render medical aid and immediately start a formal investigation of the shooting. The independent investigation called the police department's account “unsettling and not believable.” The investigation also said the decision to use less lethal munitions “may or may not have been reasonable” based on the police department’s existing policy at the time. “We recommend that further research should be conducted to identify and evaluate other munitions that are less prone to cause injuries, but are still effective as crowd control devices,” the investigators concluded. The final report compared the city’s crowd-control effort to an aviation disaster caused not by a single mistake, but by “a series of cascading events.” In Oakland’s case, the tragedy stemmed in part from  years of “diminishing resources,” and “increasing workload.” The city ultimately agreed to a $4.5 million settlement with Olsen. Once again, Oakland revised policies and training. For several years, Chanin said, the cycle of protests, shootings and lawsuits seemed to stop. Then George Floyd demonstrations broke out, and so did the less lethal weapons. According to a federal complaint filed in June by the Anti Police-Terror Project, Oakland officers indiscriminately launched projectiles, flashbangs and tear gas into crowds and at individuals. Attorneys for both sides in the case stipulated to an agreement that forbids Oakland police from using less lethal weapons against demonstrators. For Olsen, now tending bee colonies and chickens on a small Wisconsin farm, the memory with a hole came flooding back. “We passed these regulations and policies to control the use of less lethal weapons,” he said. “It’s heartbreaking to see other people’s lives affected as mine was. … Police have shown they do not care about these kinds of controls, so the next step is to take those weapons away from them.” Graphics: Javier Zarracina and Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY.

police sued,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/ct-sta-former-harvey-officer-guilty-plea-st-0726-20200724-eahybh3kzfh67j5umci4deymte-story.html,Former Harvey detective pleads guilty to falsifying police report to protect acquaintances from gun charges,"A former Harvey detective pleaded guilty Friday to obstruction of justice for falsifying a police report regarding the recovery of a firearm in order to conceal its connection to two acquaintances. Derrick Moore, who was among six Harvey officials and their associates charged last year as part of a sweeping federal probe of corruption schemes in the city, faces 12 to 18 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors said, however, that due to Moore’s continued cooperation with the government they would ask for a shorter sentence than the guidelines dictate. “We’re not agreeing to a specific percentage off,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Franzblau told the judge. “We’re just going to recommend that you go beneath the guidelines and let you decide what’s appropriate.” Because Moore’s sentencing range is only 12 to 18 months, Judge Robert Gettleman could sentence him to probation and remain within the guidelines, Franzblau said. With his admission of guilt Friday, Moore becomes the first of the Harvey officials and their associates charged last year whose criminal case has been adjudicated. Moore, 49, of Blue Island, and Derrick Muhammad, another ex-Harvey police officer who is former Mayor Eric Kellogg’s brother, were charged in March 2019 with obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The pair, under Muhammad’s direction, plotted in March 2018 to falsify a police report to obscure the ownership of a loaded firearm found in a vehicle used by a pair of acquaintances, prosecutors said. The acquaintances, a father and son who are both convicted felons and thus not legally permitted to possess firearms, had been at risk of facing criminal charges if the loaded Uzi discovered in their vehicle had been traced back to them. Muhammad told Moore in an intercepted phone conversation March 18, 2018, that they would find a way to ensure the gun “ain’t come back on nobody,” according to a criminal complaint. “We ain’t gonna make it no, no criminal investigation,” he told Moore, according to the complaint. To conceal the firearm’s connection to the pair, Moore prepared a police report saying he’d found the gun in some brush near a tow yard rather than inside the car where it actually was discovered, the complaint said. Prosecutors said Friday that shortly after the officers were arrested last year, Muhammad apologized to Moore for involving him in the deception. “I’m sorry this ever happened,” Muhammad allegedly told Moore, according to Franzblau. Moore is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 30. His assigned attorney, Ronald J. Clark, said he didn’t think Moore should have been charged with a felony for fabricating the police report and hopes the judge will sentence him to probation. “He was pretty much compelled to do what he did by his superior,” Clark said. “I don’t believe he had any malicious intent, nor did he think he was engaging in some sort of broader corruption.” The attorney said Moore had no part in the larger corruption schemes federal investigators were monitoring in Harvey, such as the alleged extortion of strip clubs and the solicitation of bribes in exchange for favorable government action. “His phone call just happened to be overheard on a line that was being tapped for much more serious things and he got sucked into it,” Clark said. He said Moore, a war veteran and longtime police officer, feels like his life has been ruined by his association with the corruption probe. The former officer, who left the Harvey Police Department shortly after being charged last year, told the court Friday that since leaving Harvey he’d worked briefly for LB Steel, a Harvey-based manufacturer, and was currently working for FedEx. Earlier this year, Moore was accused in a lawsuit of fabricating criminal charges against an Oak Forest man in an unrelated 2019 case. He faces no criminal charges in connection with the lawsuit’s allegations, which assert he arrested Tristan Smith last year on domestic battery, possession of a stolen vehicle and drug possession charges despite lacking probable cause Smith had committed those crimes. The charges against Smith were all later dismissed, court records show. Clark does not represent Moore in the civil suit, but said he believes its allegations are bogus and suspects it was brought to take advantage of the former officer’s criminal trouble. “I’d be surprised if there weren’t more (lawsuits) from everyone he’s arrested who happen to be in prison now wanting to contend he’s fabricated everything,” the attorney said. zkoeske@tribpub.com"
police sued,https://www.foxnews.com/us/surveillance-male-rights-attorney-murder-suicide-california-lawyer,Surveillance photos emerge placing 'male rights' attorney in California at time lawyer was murdered: police,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Investigators released new evidence and surveillance photos Friday that places an attorney suspected of killing a lawyer in California at the time of the murder. San Bernadino homicide detectives probing the death of lawyer Marc Angelucci received new information placing the now-deceased suspect, Roy Den Hollander in California on July 11 when the fatal shooting occurred. Investigators say that on July 7, Den Hollander arrived at the San Bernardino train station and rented a car. Four days later, Den Hollander drove his rental car to Angelucci’s house, where he shot and killed him. This July 11, 2020 surveillance photo provided by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department shows who is believed to be Roy Den Hollander, passing through Union Station in Los Angeles. (Courtesy of San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department via AP) Hollander immediately fled the area in his rental car and boarded a train at Union Station in Los Angeles and left California, police said. The information emerged as authorities worked with the FBI in Newark to investigate a separate shooting at U.S. District Judge Esther Salas' home on July 20, that killed her 20-year-old son and critically injured her husband. Den Hollander, 72, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in New York’s Sullivan County just a day after the shooting at the Salas' residence. Judge Salas presided over a gender-equity lawsuit that Den Hollander filed in 2015, where his client, a young woman from New Jersey, wanted to register for a potential military draft. He later withdrew as the lawyer in the case after being diagnosed with cancer. Meanwhile, Angelucci, a men's rights attorney, was victorious in a similar lawsuit filed in California. Den Hollander and Angelucci were also both associated with the National Coalition for Men (NCFM). Den Hollander described himself as an “anti-feminist” attorney who filed unsuccessful lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of “ladies night” promotions at bars and nightclubs, sued Columbia University for providing women’s studies classes, and sued news organizations over what he said was biased coverage. In more than 2,000 pages of often misogynistic, racist writings posted online, Den Hollander had sharply criticized Salas and other female judges. He also wrote about wanting to use the rest of his time on earth to “even the score” with his perceived enemies, using “cowboy justice.” Authorities say a package addressed to Salas along with a photograph of New York Chief Judge Janet DiFiore were among some of the objects found with Den Hollander's body. Both the Salas home and Angelucci were targeted by a gunman posing as a FedEx delivery driver, police said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Sign up now for straight-to-your-inbox delivery! The state will increase housing options for agricultural workers who must isolate or quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday. Farmworkers are an especially vulnerable group when it comes to contracting the virus — it's hard to distance and many of the low-wage earners lived in crowded places. Most counties don't track cases by industry, but data from Monterey County show that people who work in agriculture accounted for about 25% of the county's total cases as of Friday. The initiative will be modeled after the state's Project Roomkey, which is providing shelter for people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic, and is geared largely for Central California and the San Joaquin Valley. Newsom did not provide further specifics about where the additional housing would be located, how much housing would be available or when the program would begin.

A disproportionate share of those in danger come from Black and Hispanic households, two groups who have borne the brunt of negative health and economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Jan. 1, 2019, new legislation went into effect to help undo some of the nation's most stringent regulations keeping law enforcement records confidential. SB 1421 for the first time in decades gave the public access to records involving officer-involved shootings and other major use of force incidents, as well as confirmed cases of sexual assault and lying while on duty. The California Reporting Project, a statewide colation of 40 newsrooms (including ones with the USA TODAY Network), immediately began requesting those records from every law enforcement department across the state. More than 18 months later, the San Jose Police Department has refused to turn over most of those records, prompting the Bay Area News Group to sue. ""Excuses galore were behind the delays but the bottom line's SJPD wasn't even close to complying with the #Publicrecords Act #SB1421 #SB776,"" tweeted Thomas Peele, a reporter with the group and one of the project leads. Frank Pine, the Bay Area News Group’s executive editor, said the city of San Jose left the news organization no choice but to file this lawsuit. Negotiations have been slow and city officials won't give a timeline for when the records may be released, he added. “The law, however, is clear, and the taxpayers of San Jose deserve better. They deserve a government that is accountable, responsive, and responsible.” The ferocity of the coronavirus outbreak at San Quentin State Prison has intensified calls from public health and legal experts, criminal justice activists, and some elected officials to do something that many advocates have demanded for years: speed the process of dismantling America’s mass incarceration complex.

			Bay Area News Group sues San Jose for failure to release police discipline, use of force records		

	
	","GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. SAN JOSE — The Bay Area News Group has sued the San Jose Police Department to force the release of dozens of files on officer misconduct and use of force, more than 18 months after a landmark transparency law required law enforcement across California to release such records. The lawsuit comes after more than six months of negotiations — and even after Mayor Sam Liccardo’s insistence that police comply with the law, known as SB 1421. San Jose police have countered it will take years to review and release more than 80 files sought by the news organization. So far, they have released only six complete cases and partial records from 20 others. “The records sought are of critical public importance in rebuilding the public’s trust in law enforcement, especially at this moment in history when the public’s attention is focused on police practices in a way that it never has been before,” attorney James Chadwick, who represents the news organization, wrote in the 26-page suit filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court. Partnering with KQED News, this news organization has filed hundreds of public records requests statewide under SB 1421, which for the first time opened long-secret personnel records that detail police using lethal force, or committing sexual misconduct or dishonesty. Frank Pine, the Bay Area News Group’s executive editor, said the city of San Jose left the news organization no choice but to file this lawsuit. “We have been negotiating with the Police Department and City Attorney’s Office since last year and we have made very little progress, with the city refusing even to commit to a timeline for when it would release requested records,” Pine said. “The law, however, is clear, and the taxpayers of San Jose deserve better. They deserve a government that is accountable, responsive, and responsible.” The news organization filed the suit on Friday, but because the coronavirus has affected court procedures, the filing wasn’t confirmed until Wednesday morning. San Jose City Attorney Richard Doyle said on Tuesday he had not yet seen the suit but that it was “too bad” negotiations didn’t lead to a compromise to avoid a court fight. “We have diligently been working to identify records to be released,” he wrote in an email. “It has been slow, and we have added more staff to that effort.” Late last week, Mayor Liccardo stepped into the matter, saying he would attempt to force the release of the records through the city Public Information Officer. But the mayor later acknowledged he did not have the power to do so under the city charter. On Tuesday, Liccardo said the city manager is trying to get some of the documents released within 30 days. San Jose Police have estimated the department has at least 86 cases, mostly shootings, covering the 2014-to-2019 scope of the request. At one point police claimed it would take four years to process them all, citing the need to review the records and redact witness names and other information they say is sensitive to be made public, such as home addresses and phone numbers. They later revised the estimate to two years. One public records advocate likened obtaining the records from San Jose to trying to secure information from the most clandestine corners of government. “Four years is CIA-level delay and makes no sense here,” said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, a pro-transparency group. Although it is one of the poorer performers in the state, San Jose is not the only department lagging in the release of records under S.B. 1421. KQED News sued the California Highway Patrol in May over its failure to release records, and Oakland and San Francisco have been slow to release records. The Los Angeles Times sued the L.A. County Sheriff in June over the slow release of records as well. S.B. 1421’s author, Sen Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, has already introduced new legislation, S.B. 776, to broaden the types of records police are required to release and put fines in place for recalcitrant departments. Records released by the hundreds of police departments that are following the law show officers fired for sexual misconduct, stealing, and tipping off gang members about police activity. One officer who was fired by Newark police for lying in three separate police reports ended up teaching criminology classes at Cal State East Bay. Another, fired by the Alameda County Sheriff for lying, was later hired as a police officer in Pinole, a city in Contra Costa County. Records have also provided insight into police shootings and uses of force, such as the killing of a man in 2018 that led to four Oakland officers being fired. The suit comes at a time when interest in police accountability and transparency is surging nationally in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests, according to a recent poll. The poll, by two progressive think tanks, Data for Progress and the Justice Collaborative Institute, found that  “73 percent of likely voters, including 67 percent of Republicans, believe that the public has a right to know which police officers in the community have records of excessive force, sexual assault, racism, or dishonesty,” UC Hastings Law Professor Jonathan Abel, who conducted the poll with the two groups, wrote in a statement. The poll “confirms what legislators, commentators, and courts have increasingly come to recognize: suppressing information about police misconduct is not in the public interest. Policies that allow law enforcement misconduct records to be withheld from the public enable troubled officers to stay on the job, thereby posing an ongoing threat to the very communities they are supposed to protect and serve,” Abel wrote. The poll sampled 1,388 likely voters. It has a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points."
police sued,https://www.masslive.com/news/2020/07/springfield-police-officer-who-forced-man-out-of-station-by-the-throat-pleads-guilty-to-assault-incident-prompts-federal-lawsuit.html,Springfield police officer admits to assault charge; federal lawsuit filed by man he grabbed by the throat during parking ticket dispute,"SPRINGFIELD — Though cleared by his superiors and a civilian review board, Springfield Police Officer Jefferson Petrie admitted to an assault charge after forcing an angry civilian out of the lobby by his throat in 2017. Petrie admitted to the single count in Springfield District Court in March, records show, agreeing to attend anger management classes and stay 100 yards away from the victim, Jerry Bellamy. In exchange for complying with conditions set by a judge, the charges will be dismissed after one year. Bellamy, meanwhile, is suing Petrie, three other officers and the city in U.S. District Court. While the lawsuit does not specify a dollar figure, it alleges assault and battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution and civil rights violations. The complaint also alleges the city consistently fails to properly train its police force, thus “emboldening” officers to quickly resort to excessive force. The lawsuit focuses on an incident that played out in the police department lobby at 130 Pearl St., and was recorded by surveillance cameras. Video shows Bellamy, 48, walking into the station clutching a parking ticket in his hand on June 29, 2017. He intended to dispute the ticket and demanded to see a police supervisor, the complaint says. Petrie greeted him with “What’s your F’in problem” and Bellamy responded “with similar language,” according to the lawsuit. Footage from multiple angles shows Petrie quickly come out from behind his post at the public window protected by glass, clutch Bellamy by his throat and force him outside. Bellamy appears to flail when the officer shoves him then grabs him by the throat and forces him out the front door. “Less than twelve seconds after Mr. Bellamy arrived at the window, Officer Petrie left the secure part of the station and approached Mr. Bellamy in the public lobby,” the complaint reads. Bellamy said three officers joined Petrie, pushing him to the ground and continuing to punch him. Officers Colin Cochrane, Ruben Borrero and Thomas Sheehan also are named in the complaint. “The City is continuing the process of gathering documents and evidence needed to conduct and respond appropriately to discovery in this case,” City Solicitor Ed Pikula said. “As with other cases alleging police misconduct, we will continue to evaluate the options for litigation compared to alternative forms of disposition as discovery goes forward.” Petrie’s attorney, Charles Dolan, had no comment. Bellamy was arrested and charged with assault and battery and resisting arrest. Those charges were dropped by the Hampden district attorney’s office a year later. Petrie was cleared of misconduct by a civilian review board. Both current police Commissioner Cheryl C. Clapprood and her predecessor, John R. Barbieri, have defended his reaction to Bellamy in the lobby. “I don’t have a problem with the lobby video at all,” Clapprood said in a 2019 interview. “I watched it close enough to see the subject who was outside the lobby throw a punch at the officer. I thought at the time we wouldn’t have an issue with it and I still am behind the officer in the lobby video. That man came in and he was the aggressor in the disturbance.” Hampden District Attorney Anthony Gulluni’s office nonetheless sought a criminal complaint against Petrie. He was arraigned on the assault charge last year. The complaints says Bellamy lost his job after his arrest, and was unable to pay his rent or his car payments. ”Without a job his family was unable to afford their rent; as a result, Mr. Bellamy, his wife, and their two young children became homeless,” reads the complaint, filed by Northampton attorney Luke Ryan and Boston attorney Howard Friedman. Ryan said Bellamy was working as an independent contractor for a realty company at the time of his arrest in 2017. Police records show the clash in the police station lobby was not Bellamy’s first encounter with law enforcement. Between 2017 and 2020 — excluding the June 2017 arrest — Bellamy has been arrested several times for charges including home invasion, assault and battery on a family member, drug possession, assaulting a child, threatening to commit and crime and motor vehicle infractions, the records show. For his part, Petrie works in the garage at Pearl Street maintaining the department’s entire fleet of cars, police said. “Only in Springfield would an officer plead to criminal conduct and not miss a day of work,” he said, when called for comment.

police sued,https://abcnews.go.com/US/city-aurora-sued-police-response-violin-vigil-elijah/story?id=71951197,City of Aurora sued over police response to 'violin vigil' following Elijah McClain death,"Five attendees of a rally and vigil for Elijah McClain held last month in Aurora are suing the Colorado city and its interim top cop over what they say was an unconstitutional police response that ""terrorized"" peaceful protesters. On June 27, thousands of demonstrators gathered for a ""violin vigil"" to celebrate the life of McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died last year a few days after police confronted him as he was walking home from a convenience store. In social media footage of the gathering, held on the lawn of the Aurora Municipal Center, serene violin music contrasted with images of officers approaching in riot gear and spraying the crowd with pepper spray. ""Against the backdrop of the violinists' beautiful and haunting soundtrack, these officers under [Aurora Police Department] direction bullied and indiscriminately deployed chemical agents on the men, women, and children who had gathered to peacefully remember Elijah. Some even wielded batons and shot projectiles,"" states the class action lawsuit, which names the city of Aurora and Interim Chief Vanessa Wilson, among others, as defendants. ""They terrorized an already reeling and grieving community."" The plaintiffs are seeking damages for ""emotional distress, humiliation, loss of enjoyment of life and other pain and suffering,"" according to the complaint. The lawsuit is also calling for injunctive relief regarding police behavior at demonstrations, including requiring body-worn cameras to be recording and unobstructed at all times, to only give orders to disperse when there is ""imminent danger of harm to persons (not property)"" and to bar the use of chemical agents, including pepper spray, against those ""exercising their rights of free speech and assembly."" ""Today, we are proud to represent leaders of the Aurora community who have filed this class action lawsuit to do what Aurora's officials refuse to: hold Aurora's out-of-control police department accountable,"" said Mari Newman, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit Thursday, in a statement. The five plaintiffs include two members of the city's new community police task force and the chairwoman of the Arapahoe County Democratic Party. The city has not been served yet, according to Aurora City Attorney Daniel Brotzman. ""As soon as we obtain a copy of the complaint from the Court, we will begin analyzing it,"" Brotzman said in a written statement. ""Since we haven't seen it, only accounts from the media, we will need time to evaluate the claims."" ABC News has reached out to the Aurora Police Department for comment. At a June 30 virtual meeting called to address the police department's widely criticized response, Aurora's interim police chief defended the officers' actions, saying they were trying to protect peaceful demonstrators from a small group of agitators. ""I'm deeply concerned that children were frightened by that,"" Wilson said. ""People were confused by that, and I profusely apologize for that."" McClain's death has gotten renewed attention amid calls for justice for George Floyd, who died while in police custody on May 25. Nationwide protests have included violin vigils in honor of McClain, a certified massage therapist and self-taught violin player. On the night of Aug. 24, 2019, while McClain was out buying soft drinks, someone called 911 to report a suspicious person who was reportedly wearing a ski mask and waving his arms as he walked down a street. When responding police officers grabbed him, police body camera video captured McClain telling them, ""I am an introvert. Please respect the boundaries that I am speaking."" Several minutes into the video, he also could be heard saying, ""I can't breathe,"" and told the officers he was in pain as they applied a chokehold. When paramedics arrived, they gave him ketamine, a sedative. He suffered a heart attack on the way to the hospital and was later declared brain dead. He died on Aug. 30. After an investigation by the county's district attorney, the three officers did not face any charges. Last month, following a series of rallies and protests demanding justice for McClain, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis appointed state Attorney General Phil Weiser as the special prosecutor to investigate the death and potentially file charges. ABC News' Clayton Sandell and Jeffrey Cook contributed to this report."
police sued,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/family-of-black-man-shot-22-times-by-police-settles-lawsuit/ar-BB174m1y,Family of Black man shot 22 times by police settles lawsuit,"MARTINSBURG, W.Va. (AP) — A West Virginia city has agreed to settle an excessive force lawsuit filed by the family of a homeless Black man who was shot 22 times by police, an attorney said. Christopher E. Brown, the attorney for the family of Wayne Arnold Jones, told The Washington Post that the lawsuit was settled for $3.5 million. “I promised my mother before she died that we would continue to fight for justice,” Jones' brother, Bruce Jones, told the newspaper. “The settlement makes me feel a little bit better, but until I can have a chance to have these cops prosecuted, I am still going to be pushing for justice.” The Martinsburg Police Department said in a statement that the settlement was not an admission of guilt. Police had stopped Wayne Jones as he was walking on a Martinsburg street. Jones was shot after police said the 50-year-old Stephens City, Virginia, resident shrugged off two jolts from a stun gun, fought with officers and stabbed one of them. The officers are white. U.S. District Judge Gina Groh had dismissed the lawsuit. But a three-member federal appeals court panel reversed the granting of summary judgment to the officers on qualified immunity grounds last month, saying that “a reasonable jury could find that Jones was both secured and incapacitated in the final moments before his death.” The court also referenced the Memorial Day death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis after white police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck for several minutes. That death prompted protests by millions of people around the world The appeals panel noted that “although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split-second decisions, we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of black lives. This has to stop.” The police department's statement said the city's insurance carrier agreed to the settlement to avoid the ongoing costs of litigation along with the stress that a trial would bring to the officers and the families of the officers and Jones. The city of Martinsburg said in the statement that ""with this settlement, the City and the MPD hope everyone involved will be able to put this incident behind them and allow the community to heal.” A Berkeley County grand jury declined to indict the officers in the shooting. The U.S. Justice Department later said there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal civil rights charges against police. Civil rights leaders had pressed for the investigation. The Jones family has filed a separate appeal in state court seeking a grand jury investigation, Brown said. “The fact that I could tell my client that we still have a shot at criminal prosecution made the (settlement) figure very acceptable,” Brown said."
police sued,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Utah-family-sues-city-police-officers-in-15429728.php,"Utah family sues city, police  officers in killing of son","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The parents of a Utah man who was shot and killed by police in his driveway while holding a knife have filed a lawsuit against the city of Ogden and its police department. In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Juan and Rosa Mercado allege the officers had no reason to shoot their son because he posed no harm to the officers or anyone else and hadn't broken any laws. In March, Weber County Attorney Chris Allred concluded the officers were justified in their use of deadly force. Jovany Mercado, 26, was fatally shot on Aug. 16 after officers responded to a report of a man who threatened people at a party with a knife, according to the lawsuit. Mercado’s family says he was likely suffering an episode related to mental illness and didn’t threaten anyone. “He needed Ogden police to be there and save him that day, but they did not,” Mercado's sister, Ruby Mercado, told reporters Thursday. “They took his life instead when he needed help.” When officers arrived at Mercado's home, they say they told him to walk toward them and drop the knife. Four officers fired a total of at least at least 20 shots at Mercado as he began walking down his driveway with the knife in hand, according to the lawsuit. “We feel the shooting constituted grossly excessive deadly force,"" family attorney Robert Sykes said. ""Jovany was shot on his own property, as he walked toward the police as commanded. He had a pocket knife, but made no aggressive or threatening gestures or statements.” Authorities say it was larger than a pocketknife. The lawsuit names the Ogden Police Department, the four officers and the city as defendants. The department referred questions about the lawsuit to city attorney Heather White, who said the officers had no choice but to shoot Jovany Mercado because he did not drop the knife. White also added that Jovany Mercado could still pose a threat to the officers regardless of his mental state.

Your News. Your Voice. Your Times. VALDOSTA — A lawman at the center of a lawsuit claiming excessive use of force has been fired for another incident, the Lowndes County sheriff said Friday. Deputy James Stokes was fired from the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office after a situation Thursday when he was working an extra-duty assignment as security at a local night club, Sheriff Ashley Paulk said in a statement released Friday. Stokes intervened in a fight, leading to an altercation between Stokes and one of the participants in the fight, Paulk said. “Once the person realized James Stokes was law enforcement, the male ceased his resistance but James Stokes continued, using racially offensive and threatening language all in violation of the sheriff’s office use of force policy. The male sustained no apparent injuries,” the sheriff said. The matter has been turned over to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the sheriff said. Stokes had worked for the sheriff’s office for less than a year, Paulk said. Stokes, the Remerton Police Department and several Remerton city officials were recently sued in federal court on an accusation of excessive force during a Sept. 6 incident when Stokes was a police officer for the city. In the lawsuit, Nicholas Paige claims he was slapped by Stokes during an encounter where Paige was mistaken for someone else, with law enforcement entering his home and drawing guns on him. Stokes was a reserve Lowndes sheriff's deputy at the time of the Remerton incident; the sheriff’s office is not involved in the lawsuit because Stokes was acting in his capacity as a Remerton officer and not a county deputy at the time, Karla Walker, Paige’s attorney, said in a past article.

(AP) — A North Carolina man is suing after he said he was pepper sprayed, tasered and beaten by a group of Union County sheriff's deputies following a traffic stop. The Charlotte Observer reported Thursday that the lawsuit was filed by Dustin Parrish in federal court. Parrish, who is white, estimates that he was struck in the face at least 20 times. He said he was tased twice, pepper sprayed and placed in a choke hold. Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey told the Observer that Parrish ""created the violence when he assaulted an officer.” Cathey added that Parrish resisted arrest, ignored orders and tried to escape twice. Parrish claims he never assaulted an officer. His lawsuit alleges that deputies lied and trumped up charges to keep him in jail for more than 200 days before trial. He also claims he didn't get the medication he needed and had to be hospitalized. Video of the 2019 incident obtained by the Observer shows Parrish trying to escape. Another clip shows him struggling with two officers before being struck by a third. Video shows a deputy shooting pepper spray into Parrish’s eyes before another deputy appears to tase him. Bo Caudill, one of three attorneys representing Parrish, said the deputies “acted like bullies with badges.”"

In the lawsuit, Parrish said he feared for his life when authorities struck him in the face, used a taser and pepper spray on him before placing him in a chokehold. The events unfolded after a traffic stop on Lathan Road in Monroe on April 1 of last year. Parrish was a passenger in a car that was pulled over by deputies.

The Union County Sheriff's Office would not provide comment for this story. When a deputy allegedly asked Parrish to step out of the car, an altercation began. The lawsuit also states the deputies used excessive force, even as Parrish insists he complied with their commands. Video released only shows portions of the incident. The lawsuit also states Parrish was denied medical care and treatment both directly following the arrest and while he was being held in jail for several months, which led to further medical complications. Medical details on Parrish's conditions were withheld in the lawsuit provided to WCNC Charlotte. The Union County Sheriff's Office would not comment on pending litigation. Parrish spent more than 200 days in jail before appearing for trial, according to dates provided in the lawsuit.  The suit claims he pleaded guilty because he feared for his life and thought he would be able to get out of jail much sooner than if he fought the charges against him.

Days after taking office in 2019, Adams County Sheriff Richard Reigenborn forced four senior members to resign because they’d supported his opponent in the sheriff’s race — then he filled the positions with his less-qualified friends and supporters, according to a lawsuit filed earlier this month by those four former sheriff’s deputies. Former Chiefs Timothy James Coates and Gene Claps, along with former Captain Mark Mitchell and former Commander Kevin Currier  filed the lawsuit July 1 against Reigenborn and the Adams County Sheriff’s Office, alleging Reigenborn violated their rights to free speech and due process when he told them to resign or be fired one week after he took office after winning in an upset. “Literally dumped out on the curb after a 29-year career with no explanation, no anything,” Mitchell said in an interview Thursday, describing how he had to call his wife for a ride home from outside the sheriff’s office. A spokesman for the sheriff’s office declined to comment for this story because of the pending lawsuit. All four plaintiffs supported Reigenborn’s Republican opponent in the sheriff’s race, incumbent Michael McIntosh, according to the lawsuit, by donating to his campaign and publicly backing him. They also withdrew support from the Fraternal Order of Police Colorado Lodge 1, where Reigenborn served in various leadership roles for years. In individual meetings on January 15, 2019, Reigenborn, who ran as a Democrat, told the four that he wanted to “take the agency in a different direction” by making “cultural changes” designed to “get the troops in line,” according to the lawsuit, brought through law firm Rathod Mohamedbhai. He refused to explain what that direction was, Mitchell said, adding that over his career he’d worked for four different sheriffs, both Republicans and Democrats, and “politics never entered the picture.” “To say that we couldn’t fit with the new direction, without us even knowing what it was, is mind-boggling,” Mitchell said. All four men resigned from the sheriff’s office in lieu of termination in order to keep their retirement benefits, according to the lawsuit. “I dedicated my entire life to Adams County,” Coates said, adding later that the forced resignation has created a major financial loss. “It’s very painful to suddenly find yourself on the curb, and in my case I cannot get another police job; I’m too old.” Reigenborn abolished existing sheriff’s department policies the day he took office and replaced them with his own policies that gave him sole authority to make hiring, promotion and firing decisions, according to the lawsuit. The new sheriff then hired or promoted at least five of his friends and supporters, according to the lawsuit, which alleged the new hires were less qualified for the jobs than those the sheriff ousted. Michael Bethel was hired as a division chief on Jan. 22, 2019, according to a roster of sheriff’s employees. Bethel was fired from the Pueblo Police Department in 2006 after a sex tape surfaced that included him, his wife and a man with a long-criminal history, The Denver Post reported in 2015. He was acquitted of criminal charges in connection with the sex tape’s discovery and later won $20,000 in a federal lawsuit accusing Pueblo police leadership of discriminating against him because of his sexual preferences. Bethel later became chief of Rocky Ford, where his son served as an officer despite criminal convictions — some while he was a juvenile — that included use of a gun while drunk, careless driving and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to prior The Denver Post reports. Division Chief William Dunning was hired in May 2019. He’d previously left the sheriff’s office in the mid-1990s and had been working as a RV salesman before he was hired back into top police leadership by Reigenborn, according to the lawsuit. Dunning was initially hired as a civilian and has since been re-certified as a law enforcement officer, according to the sheriff’s office. Dunning and Bethel could not be reached for comment Thursday; a spokesman for the sheriff’s office said they could not comment due to the pending litigation. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages, but Mitchell said he hopes to also ensure others in the department are not deprived of due process in the future. “I would like a decision to be made that career employees have some type of due process,” he said, “and that an elected official cannot just walk in and do what happened to us.”"

The video shows officers arresting Dustin Parrish during a traffic stop. Initially, Parrish was taken to the ground. In the video, a third deputy arrives and sees the struggle on the ground before rushing over and throwing several punches. The lawsuit says Parrish was shocked with a Taser and pepper-sprayed after getting to his knees. NEW: A lawsuit has been filed against Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey and numerous UCSO deputies alleging excessive force and due process violations stemming from this April 2019 arrest. I've obtained videos of the incident. Story to come. Coverage starting at 5 on @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/o9Tn6d1Vvt Another dash camera video shows Parrish with his hands and feet restrained, being carried and forcefully put inside a cruiser. In another video, Parrish can be heard saying, “I can’t breathe.” There also are claims in the lawsuit that go beyond what can be seen in the video. Channel 9′s Joe Bruno first learned about the lawsuit Wednesday night. He has spoken with the Parrish’s attorney and a police expert about the case. According to the lawsuit, the traffic stop began with Parrish in a car with someone who had a protective order out against him. A deputy recognized the vehicle, followed the pair and pulled the car over. A deputy struck Parrish in the face at least 20 times, according to federal court documents. He was put in a chokehold, hit with pepper spray and stunned with a Taser twice. Deputies eventually put a spit bag over Parrish’s head. The documents said Parrish was denied water to flush his eyes and begged for help when the sheriff came to the scene. The lawsuit claims Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey laughed at him and said, “I can’t help you.” The documents said Parrish spent more than 200 days in jail and was denied prescribed medication for the first three months, which led to a hospital stay. Among several things, Parrish is alleging excessive force, assault and due process violations. His attorney said deputies went too far. “This case is about bullies with badges,” attorney Bo Caudill said. “Dustin Parrish was pulled over for committing a crime and instead of pulling him over and treating him with basic human dignity that every person deserves to be treated with, certain deputies with the Union County Sheriff’s Office beat him up.” The Union County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. Channel 9 spoke with Scott McClatchie, who is a use of force expert and specializes in police encounters. He said punching is a tactic police use during resistance. “I saw a deputy on his back,” McClatchie said. “If I was responding to a backup call on a fight or a struggle, and I saw a fellow officer on his back or the ground, I’d be pretty concerned.” The attorney for Parrish denies he was resisting. © 2020 Cox Media Group.

sheriff sued,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/snohomish-county-sheriff-adam-fortney-sued-over-2018-use-of-force-case/ar-BB16NBU6,Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney sued over 2018 use-of-force case,"A federal lawsuit has been filed against Snohomish County and Sheriff Adam Fortney over a ""use-of-force"" case from 2018. Ada Wong, the lawyer representing Paul Barracliffe, called the incident a ""vicious attack."" The lawsuit claims the sheriff’s office’s “reckless conscious disregard for the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, have caused Plaintiff Paul Barracliffe II to suffer deprivation of his civil and constitutional rights, physical injury, and severe mental and emotional distress.” According to the lawsuit, Fortney was a sergeant at the time of Barracliffe's arrest, and was one of the seven law enforcement officers who responded to the call. On Sept. 26, 2018, Barracliffe’s mother called 911 for a mental health wellness check on her 32-year-old son. Barracliffe had suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2008 and was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to his attorney. “It was late at night and he was sitting on his couch, watching TV and police officers came,” Wong said. According to the lawsuit, officers arrived at the home, threw Barracliffe on the ground and repeatedly punched and used tasers on him. Barracliffe did not resist arrest, according to Wong. “They put a bag over him and walked him outside and that’s when one of the officers released his canine dog to hold onto Paul’s foot,” Wong said. The lawsuit is filed against Snohomish County, Fortney and several other deputies. One of those deputies is Arthur Wallin. A month after this case, Deputy Wallin was fired for a separate use-of-force case, where he shot and killed 24-year-old Nickolas Peters following a chase by Snohomish County deputies in October 2018. When Fortney was elected sheriff this year, he reinstated Wallin. “With what the situation he was put in that night, I find his actions reasonable,” Fortney said in a January 2020 press conference about hiring back Wallin. While the reinstatement is not the direct reason the lawsuit was filed Wong said her client is concerned that Wallin was let back onto the force. “It doesn’t necessarily play into why they filed a lawsuit. The lawsuit was brought because what they did was absolutely wrong,” she said. “For Sheriff Fortney to reinstate him, we think is absolutely reckless. They’re not taking any responsibility, they’re not making any changes and they’re putting our citizens at risk,” Wong said. Barracliffe is seeking $5 million in damages. “They’re not taking responsibility and there is no change. It’s affected him emotionally it’s affected him mentally and I think it’s going to affect him probably for the rest of his life,"" Wong said. The Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office told KING 5 they cannot comment on pending legal matters. A public records request for documents related to this case is pending."

            Man who sued Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office sentenced to prison; 30-year-old led officers on 2 chases
        
    ","A man who sued the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office and received a settlement of $260,000 has now been sentenced to prison. Quinnton Jamar Henderson, 30, with addresses in Orangeburg and Bowman, pleaded guilty on July 8 to first-degree assault and battery, second or subsequent offense of failure to stop for blue light, threatening the life of a public official and first-offense distribution of methamphetamine. Prosecutors dismissed the charges of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in close proximity to a school, pointing and presenting a firearm, possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a violent felony, third or subsequent driving under suspension, kidnapping, first-offense failure to stop for blue light and first-offense possession of 28 grams or less of marijuana. Circuit Judge Ed Dickson sentenced Henderson to six years in prison. A 2014 pursuit ultimately resulted in Henderson receiving $260,000 in a settlement with the sheriff’s office. Henderson claimed then-deputy Lacra Sharod Jenkins used his sheriff’s office patrol vehicle to strike Henderson “in an attempt to apprehend him.” Henderson underwent “extensive reconstructive surgery and extended hospital stays,” according to the lawsuit. Orangeburg County’s insurance carrier paid the settlement. Henderson was arrested on several charges by the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety in 2018. That same year, on Sept. 22, Henderson led Holly Hill Police Department officers on a chase that ended in Clarendon County. A year and five days later, Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office deputies attempted a traffic stop on Henderson. The chase went through Calhoun and Lexington counties.

sheriff sued,https://www.news-press.com/story/news/crime/2020/07/24/florida-ethics-commission-clears-lee-county-sheriff/5487240002/,Ethics Commission investigators don't find probable cause in complaint against Lee County sheriff,"Investigators from the Florida Commission on Ethics have dismissed a complaint filed against Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno, according to the former sheriff that filed it. Rod Shoap had filed the complaint accusing Marceno of misusing his position to enter into a sexual relationship with a crime victim nearly a year ago after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement declined to open an investigation due to a lack of ""criminal predicate."" Shoap, who lives in Tennessee, told The News-Press that he attended a closed-session meeting Friday morning in Tallahassee and investigators claimed Marceno met with the woman after the case was closed, a statement he said could be disproved by two text messages where Marceno promised to help her. He said that based on the evidence he collected, it should have been a straightforward case for investigators to prove. ""I'm totally in shock,"" Shoap said. ""I've been in criminal investigations for 30 years and there were some things here that I've never seen before."" Shoap said he was particularly startled by the ethics commission investigator discussing the case with Marceno's attorney before the hearing began. Marceno expressed his satisfaction with the commission's findings and reiterated his belief that the complaint was politically driven in a statement to The News-Press. “I’m gratified, but not surprised that I have been completely exonerated and that these foolish, politically motivated accusations have been proven false,"" Marceno said. ""Unfair attacks come with my job, but they have not, and will not distract me from my primary focus, the safety and security of the residents of Lee County”. The commission is an independent body made up of nine members who examine complaints alleging breach of the public trust by public officers and employees. Once a determination has been made about legal sufficiency, the commission undertakes a preliminary investigation and determines if there is probable cause to believe an ethics violation occurred. If the commission finds probable cause, it determines whether a violation occurred or if the commission should recommend a penalty. Shoap was allowed to attend the closed-session meeting because of his role as the complainant. He said he was told the investigation will become public record next week. Shoap's complaint took aim at the actions of Marceno, then-undersheriff of the agency after Deanna Williams attempted to file a criminal complaint with the Sheriff's Office's Economic Crimes Unit in 2018. The complaint alleged Marceno initiated contact with Williams and then accused him of injecting himself into her complaint as he courted her. In an interview with FDLE, Williams said they were in a relationship from July to September 2018, which ended when she told him that she was pregnant. She said Marceno wanted her to have an abortion, which was corroborated by text messages provided to the FDLE. Williams said she eventually gave birth to a stillborn baby. Williams said she felt she was not in a willing relationship because of who Marceno was at the Sheriff’s Office, his power to move her criminal complaint forward and statements she perceived as threats. Among the other allegations made in the complaint were that Williams and Marceno engaged in sexual activity in his Lee County Sheriff's Office vehicle, making him ""on-duty"" at the time and in violation of Florida statutes, Shoap wrote. Williams expressed her anger Friday after learning of the complaint's disposition. ""I went to law enforcement as a reporting crime victim for help and that's what I expected,"" Williams said. ""I did not expect what happened thereafter."" Connect with reporter Devan Patel: @DevanJPatel (Twitter) or devan.patel@naplesnews.com"
sheriff sued,https://journalgazette.net/news/local/courts/20200723/sheriff-defends-deputies-in-protest-lawsuit,Sheriff defends deputies in protest lawsuit,"Allen County Sheriff David Gladieux denies claims in a federal lawsuit that his deputies used ""unreasonable force"" during Black Lives Matter protests in downtown Fort Wayne. He instead blames demonstrators in court documents filed Thursday for causing disruptions that led to officers using tactics such as firing tear gas to disperse crowds in late May and June. Protesters turned violent, people were hurt, property was damaged and ""community safety"" was threatened, the documents say. ""(Gladieux) admits that no member of the Allen County Sheriff's Department has indicated that any mistake occurred,"" attorney J. Spencer Feighner wrote for his client. ""By way of further response, the Defendant asserts that any use of force was made in response to unlawful conduct from protesters. The Defendant expressly denies that any member of the Allen County Sheriff's Department used unreasonable force or tactics against any peaceful protest."" The comments are included in a 66-page response to a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Wayne by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana on behalf of more than a dozen protesters. The lawsuit challenges police actions and asks a judge to bar officers from using tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray in similar situations. Gladieux is the first to respond to protesters' claims. The city has not yet answered the allegations, but Judge Damon R. Leichty has set a July 30 deadline for a response. An Oct. 15 evidentiary hearing is scheduled in a portion of the case that seeks to bar police from using the tactics on demonstrators as the case moves forward. A separate portion asks a judge to make the ban permanent. The ACLU filed the lawsuit June 26 on behalf of protesters Taylor R. Crane, Kendall Dimond and Matt Carmer. Other plaintiffs including Black and Brown Liberation – a local group formed ""to engage in organized activities to combat racial bias in the United States and in Allen County, including systemic racism in policing that negatively affects persons and communities of color,"" court documents said – were added July 2. More than 100 protesters including Crane were arrested following protests May 29-31, and most face misdemeanor charges including rioting, disorderly conduct and resisting police. mleblanc@jg.net"
sheriff sued,https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/2020/07/24/oneida-woman-sues-tribal-police-brown-county-forcefully-removing-her/5501182002/,"Oneida woman sues tribal police, Brown County officials for removal from tribal meeting","ONEIDA – An Oneida woman is appealing a federal judge's dismissal of her lawsuit against four tribal police officers over her forced removal from a general council meeting in 2018. Madelyn Genskow claims she was carried out of the meeting by the officers under the direction of Tribal Chairman Tehassi Hill after she kept repeating the phrase, “point of order,” according to court records. She filed a separate federal lawsuit against two Brown County officials, Sheriff Todd Delain and County Executive Troy Streckenbach on May 12 seeking $1 million. A scheduling conference, in that case, is scheduled today. She said she was wanting to speak because the council was approving agenda items with little, if any, discussion, and that Hill refused to recognize her during the meeting at the Radisson Hotel, which included about 1,500 tribal members. Genskow alleges she sustained injuries as a result of the removal, as well as humiliation, damage to her reputation and that her right to free speech was violated. She sought an award of $4 million against the officers in the complaint filed Oct. 9, 2019. Judge William Griesbach of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin dismissed the lawsuit on April 6, saying it's a matter for tribal courts. “The exercise of federal jurisdiction over the Oneida Nation’s ability to conduct the meeting of its governing body on its own land would be a blatant violation of its sovereignty,” Griesbach said in his ruling. He ruled that her lawsuit against the individual tribal police officers for injuries was also barred. “Genskow seeks to impose liability on tribal police officers who physically removed her from a meeting of the Nation’s governing body on tribal land at the direction of the tribal chairman when she persisted in calling for a point of order despite the chairman’s refusal to recognize her,” Griesbach said. “The allegations of her complaint and the relief she seeks, in the form of injunctive relief against the Nation and $4 million in damages, strongly suggest that her suit is in reality against the Nation.” He argued that tribal sovereignty would mean little if its police officers are subject to a federal lawsuit whenever they are called upon to restore order to a council meeting. “At the very least, tribal sovereignty must mean that Indian tribes are free to conduct the meetings of their own governing bodies without the threat of a federal lawsuit every time they rule a disruptive member out of order and have him or her removed,” Griesbach argued. He wrote the officers were acting under the color of tribal authority and any dispute Genskow has with the manner in which she was dealt with by Hill or of the officer must be resolved in tribal court. Genskow filed an appeal of Griesbach’s dismissal on July 8 arguing that the officers were acting under state authority in part because they are deputized by the Brown County sheriff and they act under state law. She argues that she broke no law that caused the officers to remove her and accuses them of using excessive force. “The defendants exploited their state of Wisconsin law enforcement superpower by using it to show tribal citizens can and will be abused,” Genskow’s appeal said. Attorney’s for the four officers pointed to many of Griesbach’s arguments for dismissal in their response. Brown County attorneys argued in their response to the suit that per the deputization agreement the Nation agreed that the county will not be liable for any actions by deputized Oneida police officers.

sheriff sued,https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/07/22/lawsuit-against-rnc-adds-sheriff-williams-concerns-to-legal-arguments/,Lawsuit against RNC adds Sheriff Williams’ concerns to legal arguments,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The lawyers asking a judge to stop or scale back the Republican National Convention are using comments made Monday by Sheriff Mike Williams to bolster their case. In a brief added to the group’s lawsuit, the lawyers quote Williams saying, “We are simply past the point of no return to execute the event with safety and security.” The suit seeks to have a judge require the RNC and the Trump Campaign to “present a comprehensive plan to avoid or minimize the nuisance during the Republic National Convention and require accountability measures to assure it is implemented.” The additional brief filed Tuesday said if the judge doesn’t require a comprehensive plan and requires the city to enforce it, the current protocols will be ignored by the RNC organizers and the Trump campaign. To back up that assertion, the lawyers pointed to the recent visit to Jacksonville by Vice President Mike Pence to meet with the RNC host committee, saying that while a mandatory mask order was in effect, “committee members and major funders failed to wear masks event when in close proximity to one another” at the event at Epping Forest. The lawyers included a photo from a tweet from State Rep Cord Byrd showing people positing for photos without masks or social distancing as an exhibit. With my friend, fellow warrior and next great congressman from Florida @ByronDonalds to welcome VP @Mike_Pence to Jacksonville! #victory2020 pic.twitter.com/L6AKWayX00 The lawyers wrote that it is “clear that this court cannot reasonably expect Defendants RNC and Trump Campaign to voluntarily comply with safe practices at the recommendations of the CDC, it is also clear that local authorities will not voluntarily enforce safe practices against the Republican party or Defendants.” The motion contends defendants have “repeatedly demonstrated their disregard for COVID-19 safe practices” and that pattern of behavior is permitted to continue in Jax “it will pose a catastrophic health nuisance” for the city and Northeast Florida. The lawyers said daily testing of as many as 40,000 attendees and visitors is problematic at best because the city with all its testing sites would not be able to test that many people every day, and that doesn’t include local residents. The motion also points to the lag time in getting test results, that can reach five days or longer. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for July 28.

racial bias,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-management-ignored-internal-research-showing-racial-bias-current-former-n1234746,"Facebook ignored racial bias research, employees say","In mid-2019, researchers at Facebook began studying a new set of rules proposed for the automated system that Instagram uses to remove accounts for bullying and other infractions. What they found was alarming. Users on the Facebook-owned Instagram in the United States whose activity on the app suggested they were Black were about 50 percent more likely under the new rules to have their accounts automatically disabled by the moderation system than those whose activity indicated they were white, according to two current employees and one former employee, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to the media. The findings were echoed by interviews with Facebook and Instagram users who said they felt that the platforms’ moderation practices were discriminatory, the employees said. The researchers took their findings to their superiors, expecting that it would prompt managers to quash the changes. Instead, they were told not share their findings with co-workers or conduct any further research into racial bias in Instagram’s automated account removal system. Instagram ended up implementing a slightly different version of the new rules but declined to let the researchers test the new version. It was an episode that frustrated employees who wanted to reduce racial bias on the platform but one that they said did not surprise them. Facebook management has repeatedly ignored and suppressed internal research showing racial bias in the way that the platform removes content, according to eight current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity to discuss internal Facebook business. The lack of action on this issue from the management has contributed to a growing sense among some Facebook employees that a small inner circle of senior executives — including Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, and Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy — are making decisions that run counter to the recommendations of subject matter experts and researchers below them, particularly around hate speech, violence and racial bias, the employees said. Facebook did not deny that some researchers were told to stop exploring racial bias but said that it was because the methodology used was flawed. Alex Schultz, Facebook's vice president of growth and analytics, said research and analyses on race are important to Facebook but is a “very charged topic” and so needs to be done in a rigorous, standardized way across the company. “There will be people who are upset with the speed we are taking action,” he said, adding that “we’ve massively increased our investment” in understanding hate speech and algorithmic bias. “We are actively investigating how to measure and analyze internet products along race and ethnic lines responsibly and in partnership with other companies,” Facebook spokeswoman Carolyn Glanville added, noting that the company established a team of experts last year, called Responsible AI, focused on “understanding fairness and inclusion concerns” related to the deployment of artificial intelligence in Facebook products. One key source of tension for Facebook comes from the way its automated system moderates hate speech. Facebook has policies prohibiting hate speech that attacks people based on “protected characteristics” including race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation. It relies on user reports and automated content moderation tools to identify and remove this speech. In an effort to be neutral, the company’s hate speech policies treat attacks on white people or men in exactly the same way as it treats comments about Black people or women, an approach that employees said does not take into account the historical context of racism and oppression. “The world treats Black people differently from white people,” one employee said. “If we are treating everyone the same way, we are already making choices on the wrong side of history.” Employees said that this policy means the company’s automated content moderation tools proactively detect far more hate speech targeting white people than it does hate speech targeting Black people, even if the hate speech targeted at Black people is widely considered more offensive -- a hypothesis supported by academics and the company’s own internal research.. The company has conducted internal research that showed that Facebook users in the United States from both sides of the political spectrum find attacks against traditionally marginalized groups including Black and Hispanic people to be more upsetting than attacks against groups that have not traditionally been marginalized including men and white people — even when the same type of language is used. So “white people are trash” is generally considered less offensive than “Black people are scum,” but Facebook’s policies treat them the same. Data presented at Facebook policy meetings, including one attended by Vanity Fair in fall 2018, shows that users are more upset by attacks against women than they are by attacks against men. This inequity is reflected in the levels of hate speech that is reported versus taken down automatically. According to a chart posted internally in July 2019 and leaked to NBC News, Facebook proactively took down a higher proportion of hate speech against white people than was reported by users, indicating that users didn’t find it offensive enough to report but Facebook deleted it anyway. In contrast, the same tools took down a lower proportion of hate speech targeting marginalized groups including Black, Jewish and transgender users than was reported by users, indicating that these attacks were considered to be offensive but Facebook’s automated tools weren't detecting them. The employee who posted the chart to Workplace, the internal version of Facebook, said that the findings showed that Facebook’s proactive tools “disproportionately defend white men.” Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhraja said Wednesday that the company has since early 2018 considered treating different groups differently, as reported by Vanity Fair in February 2019, but that it is “very difficult to parse out who is privileged and who is marginalized globally” and so the company has not changed its policies. The episodes detailed by the current and former employees add to growing scrutiny from both Facebook critics and the company's own workers over how seriously it takes allegations of racial bias on its platforms. The company is in the midst of a major advertiser boycott that was sparked in part by social justice groups that believe it has not done enough to protect users from discrimination. Meanwhile, the social media giant is also under fire from Republican politicians who say it has a liberal tilt and unfairly censors conservative voices. Zuckerberg has tried to maintain that the platform is politically neutral and an advocate for free speech while also declining to make major changes. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook was creating new teams to study racial bias on its platforms. Facebook employees who were already working on that topic say that for years the company disregarded their work and often instructed them to stop their research. At around the same time as the Instagram episode, several pieces of research exploring race and racial bias on Facebook and Instagram were summarized and presented in a document to Zuckerberg and his inner circle, known as the M-Team. The team responded by instructing employees to stop all research on race and ethnicity and not to share any of their findings with others in the company, according to two current and one ex-employee. Schultz, who said he was part of the M-Team at the time, did not recall the specific communication, but said that some research was stopped over ethics and methodology concerns. Other attempts to study racial and social bias or oppression on the platform were stopped at the internal research review process, two current and three former employees said. Researchers, many of whom have conducted academic research of societal biases, were told they were not allowed to ask users questions about their racial identity, according to four sources. Without permission to ask users questions about racial identity, researchers — including those who conducted the Instagram study — relied on a proxy for race called “multicultural affinity,” which categorized users for advertising purposes based on their behavior according to their “affinity” for African American, Asian American or Hispanic people in the United States. While the current and former employees acknowledged this is not a perfect proxy for race, they had few other options for attempting to understand racial bias on the platform. They were also frustrated by the idea that the company was comfortable in delineating users on the basis of “ethnic affinity” for advertising purposes but not for research purposes. “Leadership wanted a standard and consistent approach to avoid biased, incorrect and irresponsible work and are proud we set up a project to do that,” Glanville said. After a ProPublica investigation in 2016, Facebook prohibited advertisers from targeting housing, employment and credit ads based on what was then called “ethnic affinity” to “prevent potential discrimination through ads,” Glanville said. It’s not the first time Facebook executives have been accused of ignoring internal research highlighting problems on the platform. A team at Facebook delivered a presentation in 2018 showing that Facebook’s algorithms were driving people apart by showing users increasingly divisive content, The Wall Street Journal reported in May, but senior executives including Zuckerberg shelved the research. Facebook responded to the article by pointing to its ""research to understand our platform’s impact on society so we continue to improve.” Whether Facebook takes that research into account has become a subject for discussion on the company's internal message boards. One engineer shared data showing the slant of Facebook's moderation practices and offered a pointed criticism of the company. “This is not a new issue. This has been going on for years. People smarter, harder working, more patient, and more professional than I have fought to address it, only to be shut down by myopic focus on bad metrics,” the engineer wrote, according to screenshots of a post on the company’s internal message boards shared with NBC News. “I’ve seen people be driven insane as leadership ignores them or outright shuts them down and commits us, again and again, to doubling down on this same path.” The engineer quit the company the same day, according to the leaked post and to two current employees, over the leadership’s lack of action on this issue and accused Zuckerberg of making misleading statements about the company’s handling of hate speech. “For months I’ve wrestled with myself, tried to convince myself that the work was definitely good, that it was all worth it — but I can’t,” he wrote. “The issues are too glaring, the failures of leadership too grievous. I’ve lost too much sleep wondering how many people having an awful day I’ve hurt just a little bit more by silencing their opportunity to vent with their friends, or how many other tiny injustices I’ve inflicted in the course of following orders.” The engineer did not respond to several requests for comment. “The mere fact we have this research, and continue to find the best way to conduct this and similar research, is because we are trying to understand,” Facebook said. These revelations echo the findings of an external civil rights audit that Facebook commissioned in 2018 and was published this month. The audit report revealed that the company has not done enough to protect users from discrimination, falsehoods and incitement to violence. “I don’t think they understand civil rights,” said NAACP president Derrick Johnson, who was among the civil rights leaders to meet with Zuckerberg and Sandberg in the week the audit was released. “They have a blind spot to the needs to protect people and unfortunately, far too often, they conflate issues related to civil rights with partisanship. Defeating hate isn’t a partisan question.” Olivia Solon is a tech investigations editor for NBC News in San Francisco."
racial bias,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/22/police-bias-training-push-has-startups-racing-cash/,Startups cash in on racial justice reckoning with costly police bias courses,"The racial justice movement has police departments nationwide desperately seeking training programs to help their officers navigate interactions with minorities, and it has spawned a cottage industry of companies offering training to overcome implicit bias. The courses can cost as much as $1,000 per officer, which is drawing players into the field that police chiefs say they have never heard of before. Worries also abound that these fly-by-night startups could do more damage than good. Adopting the wrong techniques could leave departments even more vulnerable to scrutiny and lawsuits. “Every time a national police story pops up, some group tries to take advantage of it,” said Chief Joseph Lukaszek of Hillsdale, Illinois. “For every 10 emails I get every single day, two are for this kind of crap.” He said some of the solicitations “are absolute pyramid schemes.” “It looks good on a piece of paper, but is it effective? And do you want to be the test case?” he said. Companies flagged by chiefs didn’t respond to inquiries from The Washington Times about their courses and their credentials. The person who answered the phone at one company said he was only marketing the training and couldn’t vouch for the training. He declined to provide contact information for those who operated the course. Protesters and politicians are putting pressure on law enforcement to provide training on implicit bias in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death. At the same time, they are calling to slash police budgets, leaving departments with less funds for training. Texas last month ordered all police officers to attend a course on implicit bias. A similar edict was imposed in Milwaukee, and the City Council in Nashville, Tennessee, is weighing mandatory training for officers. The New York Police Department recently agreed to a two-year, $4.5 million contract with a private company to provide training. Proper training can be of great value, police chiefs say, but they warn that increased demand for training and reduced budgets could lead departments to choose training based on cost, not quality. That’s dangerous, they say, because cheap training is likely worthless. “I think there should be a push to force people to make sure the dollars they spend on training are worthwhile, particularly as we defund and reimagine the police,” said Chief Jeff Kruithoff of Springboro, Ohio, who also is a board member of the FBI National Academy Associates. “If you can’t afford quality training, you should be pressured to get out of law enforcement because you are exposing the entire occupation,” he said. Smaller departments are particularly vulnerable because they don’t have the staff to vet the companies. Some departments simply hire the first company that comes along after the mayor or other officials order training. “Use of force lawsuits always — 100% — go back to the training,” Chief Lukaszek said. “Lawyers want to see the syllabus, the teacher and instructor. You call the company for their expert testimony, and they are nowhere to be found. You are stuck holding the bag with nothing to fall back on.” Police chiefs say vetting and certification are more important than ever in the current environment. The Police Executive Research Forum, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADELST) are among those that vet police training. Peggy Schaefer, who oversees certification for IADELST, has seen an uptick in organizations seeking a stamp of approval. She said some of the groups disappear soon after she explains the standards for certification. “There are a lot of training programs out there that are a series of power points and slides and a video, and they call that training,” she said. Yet few who go through the process are rejected. Since 2015, only 33 of the 216 companies that have applied for an IADELST certification have failed. Ms. Schaefer said she wants applicants to meet the standards because of the extreme need for training. Police training is definitely a seller’s market, which is enticing entrants. “Currently, you might have a few companies in the implicit-bias realm, and they cannot service the entire 18,000 departments across the country,” Ms. Schaefer said. Some training programs, though, resist the demand for certification. “There is no national standard and group of organizations that thoroughly vet all of the classes out there. And if some group does put a stamp of approval out there, what does that mean? Because who vets their vetting process?” said Jim Glennon of Calibre Press, who has been training on implicit bias since 1995. Mr. Glennon, who used to teach interview and interrogation, said his courses are more nuanced than others because his degree in psychology helps officers delve into the way the unconscious mind works. “It is not a racism class; it is an implicit bias class,” he said. Calibre Press, he said, has taught more than 20,000 officers per year for over 40 years. “There is a certain complexity because we are all biased. You can tell when your spouse is going to be so touchy about a certain subject,” he said. The benefits of the training go beyond racial matters and can be useful for officers who have to interact with pedophiles, people who are drunk and others who have acted negatively toward them in the past, he said. Randy Means of Randy Means & Associates, who has been training law enforcement for 40 years and on implicit bias since the 1990s, said he has not seen the need for certification. “You could make an argument that I would have been a better businessman if I had got the certification,” Mr. Means said. “I didn’t feel like I needed that. I have had training come in the door because of my merit as opposed to connections and associations with others.” He works with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and only recently began promoting his classes widely because of demand. His courses include content created by Black officers who have been on both sides of the divide between police and Black communities. “This has become a hugely important issue post-George Floyd,” said Mr. Means, “because now more than ever so many people across society — and not all in the same political camps — say this has got to change.”"

In a campaign video with his vice president and the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, Obama said race remains a problem in America, including “how communities of color are policed, how, you know, police are interacting and, and oftentimes acting in ways that are racially biased.” Obama, the first Black president, said protests that erupted nationwide after the death of George Floyd in police custody May 25 in Minneapolis reflected an extraordinary mobilization of every race and creed who united to say: “We’re past time to do something about this.” Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning. For his part, Trump has sided with law enforcement in sometimes violent clashes with protesters aimed at preventing property damage from Washington to Portland. ""In recent weeks, there has been a radical movement to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police departments,"" Trump said Wednesday in announcing additional deployments of federal authorities. ""Extreme politicians have joined this anti-police crusade and relentlessly vilified our law enforcement heroes. To look at it from any standpoint, the effort to shut down policing in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence."" The Department of Homeland Security sent federal officers to Portland to quell violence there, despite requests from the mayor and governor to leave. After sending additional federal authorities to Kansas City, Trump announced Wednesday that he extended the program to Chicago and Albuquerque. ""This bloodshed must end,"" Trump said. Obama acknowledged having protests against racism and police violence during his administration after the 2014 shooting death by police of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. But Obama contrasted his administration’s response with Trump's, saying he drew together a task force of police chiefs, academics and members of Black Lives Matter to develop recommendations. ""Our response was not to ignore those problems,"" Obama said. “And we arrived at a series of recommendations that are still pertinent to this day."" Biden said the goal was to increase police training. “The point was that they know they need more guidance,” Biden said."
racial bias,https://www.consumerreports.org/car-insurance/car-insurance-rates-to-be-studied-for-racial-bias/,Car Insurance Rates to Be Studied for Racial Bias,"For decades, insurance companies have been accused of charging minority drivers more for car insurance. Now, state regulators plan to reexamine how insurers set rates, including the use of credit scores, education, and occupation to determine premiums. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which sets guidelines for state insurance regulators, recently announced that it would analyze industry rate-setting practices to determine whether they have a negative impact on minorities. The move is significant because insurers are regulated at the state level rather than by the federal government. ""Within the NAIC, we're seeing unprecedented discussions between our members and stakeholders on race and its role in the design and pricing of insurance products,"" said Ray Farmer, NAIC president and director of the South Carolina Department of Insurance in an emailed statement. ""It is the duty of the insurance sector to address racial inequality while promoting diversity."" The move follows long-standing complaints that auto insurers have been found to charge higher premiums to minority drivers. As a 2017 investigation by Consumer Reports and ProPublica found, some major insurers were charging drivers in minority neighborhoods rates as much as 30 percent more than drivers in other areas with similar accident costs. This analysis was limited to the four states—California, Illinois, Texas, and Missouri—that collected the information necessary to do these comparisons. The other states said they didn’t have the necessary data. In 2018, as a result of our report, California regulators required two insurers, Nationwide and USAA, to adjust their car insurance rates. They said their review confirmed our finding that linked the pricing disparities to incorrect applications of a California law allowing insurers to cluster neighboring ZIP codes into a single rating territory. The difficulty of obtaining data on insurance pricing highlights drawbacks of insurance regulation on a state-by-state basis. Moreover, many states allow car insurance premiums to be tied at least in part to credit scores, education, and occupation. For example, though a handful of states, including California and New York, ban the use of credit histories in setting auto insurance prices, most do not. Auto insurers argue that use of this type of data has predictive value in determining which drivers are likely to incur costly claims. ""More consumers benefit from the use of credit-based insurance scores than not,"" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, in an emailed statement. ""Eliminating or placing constraints on this risk assessment factor would penalize these individuals and ban the competitive efficiency of the insurance marketplace."" But consumer advocates say that relying on these factors can be unfair and racially discriminatory. Many Blacks and other minorities tend to have low credit scores, and fewer graduate from college, which would tend to penalize them under insurers' formulas. ""The use of credit scores and other factors by insurers that have nothing to do with risk reinforces racial inequalities already present in our society,"" says Chuck Bell, programs director, advocacy for Consumer Reports. ""As a result, Black and Latinx consumers end up paying more for insurance or get denied coverage altogether."" Adds Bell, ""NAIC's decision to form this committee is a good first step, but the time for action is long overdue. Insurance companies must be required to end these discriminatory practices and restore fairness to how they set their rates so that all families can get the coverage they need."" The NAIC says it will make recommendations about these practices to its membership by year end. I cover everything from retirement planning to taxes to college saving.

racial bias,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-repeals-fair-housing-rule-200513035.html,"Trump repeals rule meant to integrate neighborhoods, further stoking racial divisions in campaign","With President Trump facing sagging support in the suburbs, his administration on Thursday targeted an Obama-era affordable housing regulation, the latest in a series of appeals to white voters' fears of crime and declining property values. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it would scrap a regulation known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which was implemented by President Obama in an attempt to promote more integrated communities. Under the rule, cities receiving some federal housing aid had to develop plans to address patterns of segregation or risk losing money. The new regulation from the Trump administration would allow local governments much broader latitude in deciding if their policies were racially discriminatory. ""Washington has no business dictating what is best to meet your local community's unique needs,"" Ben Carson, Trump's housing secretary, said in a statement. The announcement may have less practical effect in California than elsewhere in the country. In 2018, after Carson first announced plans to unwind the Obama fair housing rule, state legislators passed a bill enshrining a similar effort in state law. Thursday's decision follows Trump's embrace of racist rhetoric to defend Confederate statues, attack Black Lives Matter protesters and, more recently, to criticize housing policies. He's claimed that Democrats want to ""abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far-left Washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions,"" and he's warned that they'll be ""bringing who knows into your suburbs, so your communities will be unsafe and your housing values will go down."" Trump's rhetoric presents a picture of peaceful suburbs and chaotic cities, one that reflects, in part, his background as a landlord who settled a Justice Department lawsuit that accused his family's company of discriminating against Black tenants, and his formative experiences in New York in the 1970s and 1980s. Experts on housing call the image an outdated caricature. ""Trump is really in a time warp,"" said Richard Florida, an urbanist at the University of Toronto. As if to prove the point, Trump tweeted a message to the ""Suburban Housewives of America"" after his administration's announcement on Thursday, saying ""Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream."" But white voters today are more likely to see racial bias as a problem, according to polls conducted in the wake of nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. In addition, the nation's crime rate peaked in the early 1990s and has declined fairly steadily since then. And although individual neighborhoods across the country continue to be highly segregated, the suburbs as a whole are not as racially uniform as they once were. Over the last three decades, the share that whites make up of the residents of long-standing suburban communities — such as those in the Inland Empire — has dropped 20 percentage points, with whites now making up less than 60% of those suburban dwellers, according to demographer William Frey, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program. “Generally, the image that suburbs are white bastions is one that hasn't been true for several decades,” he said. Although Trump has tried to suggest that Obama's housing rule would lead to more dangerous neighborhoods, academic research also has shown little to no link between affordable housing and higher crime rates. A recent study conducted by Stanford University economists found affordable housing developments led to crime reductions in low-income areas and had no effect in higher-income neighborhoods. “The infinitesimal risk of increased crime as a result of increased ‘affordable’ or multifamily housing in U.S. suburbs is massively outweighed by the benefits to those actually housed, and other benefits of reducing concentrated poverty,” said Michael Lens, an associate professor of urban planning and public policy at UCLA who has studied the issue. Trump divided the suburban vote almost evenly with Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and he won the support of more white voters. Now that he's trailing badly in the polls to Joe Biden, he's been increasingly unabashed in appealing to racism among his supporters. This week, for example, the White House threatened to veto bipartisan legislation to fund the Pentagon because it included a provision that would rename military bases that had been named after Confederate leaders. Trump has also enlisted the support of Mark and Patricia McCloskey, a white St. Louis couple who pointed guns at Black Lives Matter protesters from the lawn of their mansion. They made an appearance on a campaign call, and they've since been charged by a local prosecutor with unlawful use of a weapon. Corey Lewandowski, a senior advisor to Trump's campaign, denied the appeals were racist, calling that characterization ""completely egregious."" ""I believe Black people live in the suburbs too,"" he said. As far as Trump raising the specter of spiraling crime, Lewandowski said: ""The issue of law and order is at the top of mind for many people."" Trump’s rhetoric and actions, however, continue a century-long history of the federal government working with private real estate interests to develop and maintain segregated communities, especially in the suburbs, said Paige Glotzer, a historian at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and author of the book “How the Suburbs Were Segregated.” After the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed zoning rules that specifically separated whites from Blacks in housing in 1917, a series of local and federal practices, including mortgage redlining and providing housing assistance only to white World War II veterans, effectively blocked Black residents from living in newly developed suburban communities. “What it meant to be successful was to live in the suburbs,” Glotzer said. “But the only way you could live in the suburbs was to be white. That helped to cement an idea that African Americans were not there due to some personal failings when in fact it was decades of public and private segregation that was often enforced with violence.” In 1968, the passage of the Fair Housing Act aimed to ban racially discriminatory housing practices and integrate previously segregated communities. But with the approval of the federal government, many suburban homeowners blocked such efforts by playing on fears about urban disorder, crime and lower property values. Trump’s similar fear-based appeals, Glotzer said, have “been coded to mean race for so long. Trump knows that his audience understands what he’s saying and who he’s referring to.” Although Trump has been facing a backlash over his racist rhetoric and heavy-handed crackdown on protests, he could still find political success with a more narrow focus on housing, said Karyn Lacy, a sociologist at the University of Michigan whose work focuses on the changing nature of America's suburbs. ""For the majority of Americans, their home is their only, and certainly most valuable, asset. Embracing debates about supposed increases in crime and declining property values once Blacks move in — that’s racist too, but white suburban voters may accept it if they believe doing so will protect their asset,"" Lacy said. Fights over adding housing in the suburbs are not always partisan, as shown by recent experience in California. For the last three years, Democratic state lawmakers tried to push through legislation to increase apartment construction in neighborhoods now zoned almost exclusively for single-family homes — an effort that could have had an especially strong effect in remaking wealthy suburban Bay Area and Los Angeles communities. While opposition to the proposal included many activists from low-income renter organizations worried about gentrification and displacement, some of the most intense hostility came from suburban homeowners in liberal neighborhoods who complained about the potential loss of local control over development and their community character. The state plans failed earlier this year. Lawmakers are now weighing less aggressive proposals to increase homebuilding in suburban communities."

The account removal system, designed to remove bullying and other problematic content from the company's platforms, was introduced to Facebook-owned Instagram even though researchers noted that users whose activity suggested they were Black were about 50 percent more likely to have their accounts disabled compared with users perceived by the app to be white, two current and one former employee told NBC News. When their findings were reported to managers, the employees said they were told to cease any further research into the racial bias of the system and to not share the information with their colleagues. More than a half a dozen other current and former Facebook employees told NBC that management at the company had repeatedly dismissed internal research regarding racial bias in moderation practices. Facebook's vice president of growth and analytics Alex Schultz pushed back, saying that the company hadn't ""ignored research."" ""In this specific case we have put additional standards to ensure we approach the work of analyzing bias in a rigorous and ethical way,"" Shultz told The Hill in a statement. “There will be people who are upset with the speed we are taking action,” Schultz said, adding that Facebook has ""massively increased our investment” in comprehending hate speech and any algorithmic bias.

racial bias,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/facebook-to-look-more-closely-at-potential-racial-bias-on-its-platforms/ar-BB171vYU,Facebook to look more closely at potential racial bias on its platforms,"Facebook  said Tuesday that the main social network and Instagram , its photo service, will be stepping up efforts to address challenges minorities face on its platforms and examine potential racial bias in its algorithm and products. The move comes as Facebook is under more pressure to combat hateful content on its site in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in Minneapolis. Civil rights groups have criticized the company for not doing enough to address hate speech, prompting major advertisers to halt spending on Facebook this month as part of a campaign. Black users and other minorities have also complained that their posts about racism are mistakenly flagged by the company for hate speech. Mark Luckie, a former manager at Facebook who is Black, has also accused the social network of ""failing"" its Black users, noting that there's a theory that their content is pulled down more than other groups. ""The racial justice movement is a moment of real significance for our company,"" said Vishal Shah, Instagram's vice president of product in a statement. ""Any bias in our systems and policies runs counter to providing a platform for everyone to express themselves."" Instagram is creating a new team focused on ""ensuring fairness and equitable product development."" Called the Equity team, the Instagram employees will also support features that promote equality such as tools that help diverse businesses. The team will work with Facebook's Responsible AI team. Facebook is also creating an Inclusivity product team and it recently launched a council that will help incorporate the views of Black users and other minorities as it develops new products. Facebook and Instagram have been under fire for not doing enough to combat hate speech. The Wall Street Journal, which reported earlier about the creation of the new teams, said that studying racial bias has been a ""contentious"" issue within Facebook and Instagram in the past. An internal study showed that users whose activity suggested they were Black were 50% more likely to have their accounts disabled than other users if Instagram made changes to what accounts get deleted or suspended. Instagram addressed those concerns but barred more research into the issue. Facebook told the Journal that it was concerned that the metric used to determine a user's race wasn't entirely reliable. As part of the study, workers looked at users' ""multicultural affinity,"" which have suggested to advertisers in the past whether a user is interested in ads related to African American, Hispanic American or Asian American communities. The social network has assigned users a ""multicultural affinity"" based on their activity on the platform. Facebook doesn't ask users to provide their race so using this metric could suggest to the social network who is a minority. The company disabled the ability for advertisers to target users by ""multicultural affinity"" in 2017 because of concerns that advertisers could use the tool to exclude people of certain races. Facebook said that its work to study and address potential racial bias is still in the early stages but it plans to share more in the coming months."

The teams will focus on the experience of Black, Hispanic and other minority users, the company said Tuesday. Scrutiny of the company has intensified since nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd brought the issue of racial justice to the forefront. Hundreds of brands are boycotting Facebook and Instagram this month, giving voice to criticism that these platforms stifle Black users while failing to shield Black users from racially motivated hate speech and threats. “The racial justice movement is a moment of real significance for our company. Any bias in our systems and policies runs counter to providing a platform for everyone to express themselves,” Vishal Shah, Instagram’s vice president of product, said in a statement. An internal civil rights audit of Facebook’s policies and practices released earlier this month highlighted the company’s failure to rein in racism and toxic speech. “The prioritization of free expression over all other values, such as equality and non-discrimination, is deeply troubling,” civil rights activist Laura Murphy wrote in the audit, which began in 2018 at the urging of civil rights organizations and some members of Congress. In probing the challenges underrepresented groups face, Instagram said a dedicated team would review how it enforces harassment policies and how it evaluates algorithms for potential bias. The team will also work on new features to promote equity on Instagram, such as supporting minority owned small businesses, the company said. Facebook will also work on including the perspectives of Black and other marginalized users in its products, the company said. Facebook said it's consulting with civil rights groups on how to responsibly collect and study sensitive data on the race of its users. When deciding what speech or behavior to allow on its platforms, Facebook relies on a list of rules called ""Community Standards."" Facebook defines hate speech as an attack against a ""protected characteristic,"" such as race, gender, sexuality or religion. And each individual or group is treated equally, even if they do not face oppression or marginalization. Civil rights groups trace these policies to the people in a position to shape them. Despite pledges to close the racial gap, Facebook still struggles to hire, promote and retain Black employees and has few Black executives in the C-suite. About 4% of the company's current workforce is Black and 6.3% is Hispanic while 3.4% of senior leaders are Black and 4.3% are Hispanic. Black users say they have no choice but to stick with these platforms. Movements on social media have helped put the deaths of Black Americans by police officers on the public agenda, along with racial disparities in employment, health and other key areas, they say. To elude bans when talking about racism, Black users say they resort to using a white avatar, digital slang such as ""wypipo"" or ""huite"" or a cloud emoji as phonetic or visual stand-ins for white people. They operate under aliases and maintain backup accounts to avoid losing content and access to their community. And they've developed a buddy system to alert friends and followers when someone has been sent to Facebook jail, sharing the news of the suspension and the posts that put them there. Harassment on Facebook and Instagram has gotten worse as nationwide protests following Floyd’s death in police custody draw renewed attention to historic racial inequities, Black users say. Private groups discussing racial justice and police brutality report being swarmed by organized networks of white supremacists, who use racial slurs and tell them to go back to Africa."
racial bias,https://news.yahoo.com/op-ed-lot-more-diversity-100003240.html,Op-Ed: It will take a lot more than diversity training to end racial bias in hiring,"In the midst of a national reckoning on race, many companies have reaffirmed their commitment to racial equity and justice. But as business school professors, we’re used to hearing that large, prosperous companies are making efforts to diversify their workforces and yet have found it difficult to make progress. What is holding them back? To find out, we needed to learn more about the hiring practices of these companies, the kind with active diversity and inclusion offices and with social media feeds declaring “Black Lives Matter.” What we found was alarming. These firms said they were actively seeking diverse candidates, yet they still discriminated against people of color and women. Our results suggest they did not even realize that they were biased in their evaluations of potential new hires. For this research, we examined 72 employers who recruit graduating seniors at the University of Pennsylvania for full-time positions. Among these were Fortune 500 companies, tech firms, big banks, consulting firms, hedge funds and nonprofit organizations. We gave each employer 40 randomly generated résumés to review. They knew that the résumés were not from actual students but also knew that their ratings of these résumés (on a 10-point scale) would be used by our machine learning algorithm to match them with real candidates. This gave them an incentive to rate the résumés carefully and honestly. Since the résumé components were randomized, employers saw résumés with various GPAs, academic majors, work experiences and skills. We also randomly assigned names indicative of gender and race, allowing us to see if recruiters responded differently to résumés with the same qualifications but different demographic characteristics. What we found surprised us. While 90% of the employers reported explicitly factoring into their hiring the goal of increasing racial and gender diversity, we saw no preference for female or minority candidates in their ratings. In fact, employers hiring in STEM fields penalized résumés with minority or female names. The effect was big: These candidates were penalized by the equivalent of 0.25 GPA points, based solely on the name at the top of the résumé. That meant such a candidate needed a 4.0 GPA to get the same rating as a white male with a 3.75. Our study suggested that implicit, or unconscious, bias was responsible for this disconnect between intentions and outcomes. Research shows that when decision makers are fatigued or are moving fast, their decisions are more likely to be based on cognitive shortcuts that can introduce bias. Indeed, in our study, discrimination against minorities and women was more pronounced toward the end of each set of résumés the employer viewed, when less time was spent evaluating each one. Implicit bias, combined with perceived pushes for diversity, can help explain other troubling patterns in the employers' ratings. Employers across all fields gave minority and women applicants less credit for having had a prestigious internship the prior summer. Working for a top employer (such as Goldman Sachs, McKinsey or Google), rather than having a less competitive internship, boosted ratings of white male résumés as much as an extra 0.5 GPA points. Women and minorities got roughly 33% less credit for the same internship. Employers also rated minority and female candidates as significantly less likely to accept a job offer than white male candidates. It seems that employers who think the firms in their industry are actively seeking diverse candidates assume that a female or minority candidate who snagged a prestigious internship had a leg up, leading them to give minority and female candidates less credit for such internships. Employers may similarly assume that these candidates are being aggressively recruited by other diversity-seeking firms, leading them to think these candidates would be less likely to accept a job, and potentially causing them to extend fewer job offers to these candidates. The problem with this logic, of course, is that the firms in our study — the kind giving out prestigious internships and going after top candidates — did not rate minorities and women more favorably, and employers recruiting for STEM jobs rated them worse than white males with the same qualifications. To make headway on diversity, employers must first recognize that they and their competitors may not be as diversity-seeking as they think. From there, firms must take steps to mitigate implicit bias. Attempts to do this in the past, however, have been fraught: Standard forms of diversity training do not appear to work; covering up names does not eliminate race and gender cues elsewhere on a résumé; and artificial intelligence recruiting tools can reproduce historic biases. But technological solutions are improving. And researchers are developing new ways to tackle bias. In our research method, for example, we could measure employer preferences for candidate characteristics (such as GPA and work experience) independently from race and gender. This enabled us to suppress race and gender bias when we matched employers to more than 200 real Penn seniors, allowing us to send the firms more diverse candidates than they would have likely selected on their own. Employers could integrate our method or other similar solutions into their résumé screening process. Bias in résumé screening is just one part of the problem. Eliminating bias in employment will require rethinking every aspect of the hiring and promotion process. Our research shows that good intentions and pro-diversity goals aren’t enough. Judd B.

racial bias,https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/22/1005532/facebook-says-it-will-look-for-racial-bias-in-its-algorithms/,Facebook says it will look for racial bias in its algorithms,"The news: Facebook says it is setting up new internal teams to look for racial bias in the algorithms that drive its main social network and Instagram, according to the Wall Street Journal. In particular, the investigations will address the adverse effects of machine learning—which can encode implicit racism in training data—on Black, Hispanic, and other minority groups. Why it matters: In the last few years, increasing numbers of researchers and activists have highlighted the problem of bias in AI and the disproportionate impact it has on minorities. Facebook, which uses machine learning to curate the daily experience of its 2.5 billion users, is well overdue for an internal assessment of this kind. There is already evidence that Facebook’s ad-serving algorithms discriminate by race and allow advertisers to stop specific racial groups from seeing their ads, for example. Under pressure: Facebook has a history of dodging accusations of bias in its systems. It has taken several years of bad press and pressure from civil rights groups to get to this point. Facebook has set up these teams after a month-long advertising boycott organized by civil rights groups—including the Anti-Defamation League, Color of Change, and the NAACP—that led big spenders like Coca-Cola, Disney, McDonald’s, and Starbucks to suspend their campaigns. No easy fix: The move is welcome. But launching an investigation is a far cry from actually fixing the problem of racial bias, especially when nobody really knows how to fix it. In most cases, bias exists in the training data and there are no good agreed-on ways to remove it. And adjusting that data—a form of algorithmic affirmative action—is controversial. Machine-learning bias is also just one of social media’s problems around race. If Facebook is going to look at its algorithms, it should be part of a wider overhaul that also grapples with policies that give platforms to racist politicians, white-supremacist groups, and Holocaust deniers. ""We will continue to work closely with Facebook’s Responsible AI team to ensure we are looking at potential biases across our respective platforms,"" says Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Instagram. ""It’s early days and we plan to share more details on this work in the coming months."" Technology has let us down.

officer racism,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/four-arrested-at-overland-park-protest-against-racism-police-violence/ar-BB17awhh,"Four arrested at Overland Park protest against racism, police violence","About 30 people gathered to protest Friday night starting at Johnson County Community College. By the end of the night, four protesters had been arrested. Protesters chanted phrases such as “no lives matter till black lives matter” and called to defund police as they marched down College Boulevard. They were followed by two police officers on bikes. They later marched into an Overland Park neighborhood and entered the street. That’s when police told protesters they needed to stay on sidewalks. Additional police cars showed up when protesters remained in the street. Some residents of the neighborhood yelled expletives as protesters walked past, some in the street and some on the sidewalk. “Get out of here,” screamed one resident. Another resident yelled at protesters to “get off my property.” Attorney Stacy Shaw, who had been using a megaphone, told the residents that no one was on their property. Shortly after that, Shaw, who has been vocal at numerous protests in Kansas City, and three others were arrested. City of Overland Park spokesman Sean Reilly confirmed four arrests Friday night. Reilly said three were arrested for walking in the street when a sidewalk was available. He said those arrested were warned at least three times before being taken into custody. The fourth person was arrested for battery of a law enforcement officer, Reilly said. The officer, Reilly said, was not injured. One of the people arrested said they had a cut on their hand, but refused treatment, Reilly said. Steven Wright, who attended the protest, said Shaw was arrested for “being in the street while trying to keep other people safe.” Police officers were wearing helmets with face shields. At least one carried a shield. “Basically, we came out here and we was wanting it to be peaceful and police triggered us,” Wright said. “From the protesters walking in the street, I guess the police didn’t like that they did that and they started messing with peaceful protesters.” Wright said he was overwhelmed when he saw people start to be arrested. “It scares me,” Wright said, as the remaining protesters walked back to the college to their cars before traveling to the police headquarters. “Because I’m Black and a lot of that goes on around this type of neighborhood like racism. I’m just scared of police in general because of what I’ve seen and what I’ve heard.” Outside the Overland Park Justice Center, protesters held a sit-in in the parking lot. They said they were told they couldn’t enter the center while those arrested were being processed. When the injured protester was released from custody, other protesters helped to treat their hand.. “We welcome public protests,” Riley said. “We know people have their right to express their thoughts or opinions. we welcome that. But they have to be within the legal jurisdiction.” Reilly said the representatives of the group were contacted before the protest began. By midnight Friday, three protesters had been released. ©2020 The Kansas City Star (Kansas City, Mo.)

[+] and to mark the liberation of slavery on June 19, 2020 in Washington, DC. Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when a Union general read orders in Galveston, Texas stating all enslaved people in Texas were free according to federal law. (Photo by Michael A. McCoy/Getty Images) The team around Natasha Cloud was growing, even if she didn’t realize it. When Converse decided to cover the 2019 WNBA champion’s entire salary and support her decision to sit out the season, it was really just more evidence of what was already there. From executives at Monumental, which owns Cloud’s Washington Mystics, to sponsors at Red Bull and Converse, to confidantes in the WNBA like Renee Montgomery and Tiffany Hayes, there was really no reason for Cloud to worry. Still, the decision to opt out was not an easy one. It came down to finances versus fight. “I slept and prayed on it, and (realized) at the end of the day, money should not dictate my decisions,” Cloud told me. “Money has never been the driving factor, so I was ready to take zero dollars and figure it out.” A very courageous choice was met with swift action by Converse, who made Cloud its first WNBA athlete this summer. Cloud signed a new contract worth $115,000 last winter, according to The Next’s salary database, and will be able to focus entirely on the activism that has soaked up all her time this summer without worrying about money. Cloud, long an advocate against gun violence, took on an even more outspoken role this summer when the Mystics and Washington Wizards led a march through the capital to protest systemic racism in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Both Cloud and NBA star Bradley Beal shared their own stories of being violated by  Washington, D.C. police. On her way home from getting shots up at the Mystics’ arena one night, an officer approached Cloud with his gun holster unlatched and his hand hovering over his weapon. The officer gave her a ticket for excessive window tint, but the threat was clear. More has changed in the past few months than in the year-plus since the incident. “It’s crazy to see how much momentum and how much leverage is behind this movement in 2020,” Cloud told me. “I’ve lived through a lot of these murders, and I’ve never seen this much support.” That support comes not only from her business partners like Converse, but players like Montgomery and Hayes. Shortly after Montgomery made her own decision to work in the Atlanta community during the season rather than joining her Atlanta Dream teammates in Florida at the WNBA clean site, Cloud texted Montgomery a simple message: “Way to lead, PG.” Though Cloud sees Montgomery as a leader in this space and one of the pre-eminent veterans in the WNBA, she’s grown into her own presence in the league. Cloud started all 34 games for the league champion Mystics in 2019 and averaged the most assists of her career as a full-time point guard. A powerful off-court presence and a dominant game are making her one of the new faces of the league. “One of the things that I always say is when I came to the WNBA, I found myself as a person, as a strong, independent Black woman,” Cloud said, “and it was easy to find myself because I had such powerful role models that were ahead of me and who I watched every single and it fuels you. “You learn from it, you harness it and you apply it.” It wasn’t long before Cloud embraced a leadership role herself, following Montgomery’s footsteps in opting out of the WNBA season. Players tend to be very close-knit in the WNBA, which made it so that there was very little pressure to play. And the others who opted out before Cloud gave her more confidence to do the same. While some want to play, her work right now isn’t on the basketball court, but in conference rooms and city blocks. “My journey right now is a little different than everyone else’s,” Cloud said. In Montgomery and Hayes, though, Cloud found companionship among others who also opted out. The trio started a group message shortly after Cloud opted out, and they have been fast at work finding initiatives they can partner on. “I told players, make your decision based on you, not on public opinion (or) public pressure,” Montgomery told me. “Everything you do needs to be for you because that’s who that decision is going to affect. That’s the conversation I had with anyone who called me.” While nothing concrete has come of their bond yet, Cloud has set her sights quite wide. The power and resources of Converse, a Nike subsidiary, ought to help. As Cloud told Aaron Dobson of The Undefeated, she had been in talks with Converse since last December, and paused the rollout as Cloud took to the streets in response to Floyd’s death. The company wanted a response that was tailored to Cloud’s personality as a biracial and openly bisexual athlete and activist. The partnership was eventually announced on June 8, and Converse lauded Cloud for being ahead of the curve on many of the social changes the country was finally opening its eyes to. “These systemic racial justice issues are bigger than basketball. ... We are proud to have her on the Converse team, are humbled to match her forfeited players salary and look forward to working together with Natasha on these issues as well as supporting her vision in this space.” It was off to the races after that. With the support of her fellow WNBA stars and the corporate partners she’d earned, Cloud was armed and ready for wherever the movement would take her. “When athletes speak up, they can lose their sponsorships too, so for me to go into things without a fear, that’s huge,” Cloud said. “I see Converse as not only a part of my on-court career, but we’re committed to advocating within our communities, and that’s something that Converse has done as well, really supporting the culture.” The work will be exhaustive, as it already has been from late May til now, but Cloud is prepared. An opt-out clause in her contract with the Italian franchise Schio will allow Cloud — if she chooses — to stay working rather than competing overseas this winter as WNBA players often do. Fresh off a breakout 2019 season, a championship run with the Mystics, and a jump onto the national radar, Cloud is invigorated. “This is going to be years to come, of fighting to change things within our system,” Cloud said. “When you look at it as a whole, it’s going to be kind of daunting. … It’s going to take longevity and some stamina.” I am credentialed basketball media member with work at SB Nation, OZY Sports and FanSided. I am also the co-host of the daily Locked On Phoenix Suns podcast."
officer racism,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/judge-blocks-federal-officers-from-targeting-journalists-in-portland-anti-racism-protests/ar-BB178Xjl,Judge blocks federal officers from targeting journalists in Portland anti-racism protests,"Federal officers must not target journalists or legal observers at the anti-racism protests taking place in Portland, Oregon, a judge ruled, extending a prohibition that had already been in effect for local police and delivering a win to local activists. Federal Judge Michael Simon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon issued a temporary restraining order against the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Marshals Service late on Thursday in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of individuals who were observing and reporting on the demonstrations, which have occurred nightly for nearly two months. Simon said in the order that the tactics that have been used by federal officers, including evidence that they had specifically targeted journalists and legal observers who were clearly identified and not violating the law, raised serious questions about potential violations of the First Amendment. The role of the federal law enforcement officers at the protests in Portland has come under scrutiny by civil rights advocates and elected officials. On Thursday, the Justice Department's inspector general said it would examine the conduct of federal officers in the city. Those who brought the suit claimed in legal papers that federal officers shot at them with tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and pepper balls and hit them with batons, sometimes with no warning, after they had identified themselves as members of the press. The order, which will remain in effect for 14 days, bars federal officers from ""arresting, threatening to arrest, or using physical force directed against any person whom they know or reasonably should know"" is a journalist or legal observer unless there is probable cause that the person committed a crime. Journalists and legal observers ""shall not be required to disperse following the issuance of an order to disperse, and such persons shall not be subject to arrest for not dispersing following the issuance of an order to disperse,"" Simon wrote, though he noted that they ""remain bound by all other laws."" ""This order is a victory for the rule of law,"" Jann Carson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Oregon, said in a statement. ""Federal agents from Trump's Departments of Homeland Security and Justice are terrorizing the community, threatening lives, and relentlessly attacking journalists and legal observers documenting protests. These are the actions of a tyrant, and they have no place anywhere in America."" Matthew Borden, a partner at BraunHagey & Borden who served as pro bono counsel for the ACLU, said the order was a ""critical protection for journalists and legal observers exercising their fundamental right to record and observe police activities at these important protests, and it's a victory for the nation's right to receive a full account of these events."" Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Marshals Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Local officials have raised complaints about the conduct of federal officials. Those denunciations escalated after Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who joined the protests on Wednesday evening, was hit with tear gas outside a federal courthouse. ""What I saw last night was powerful in many ways,"" Wheeler wrote in a post on Twitter on Thursday. ""I listened, heard, and stood with protesters. And I saw what it means when the federal government unleashes paramilitary forces against its own people."" Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum is pursuing a separate suit seeking to stop federal officials from allegedly snatching protesters off of sidewalks and throwing them in unmarked vans without identifying themselves as law enforcement. President Donald Trump taunted Wheeler in a post on Twitter on Thursday morning, calling him the ""Radical Left Mayor of Portland"" who Trump said was ""booed & shouted out of existence by the agitators & anarchists. Love watching pathetic Never Trumpers squirm!"" Trump has blasted the actions of protesters in Oregon and around the country who have demonstrated against police brutality following the May killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis. The federal government has said in court papers that it has deployed more than 100 officers to Portland, and Trump has threatened to send agents to other cities led by liberal mayors where he has claimed protest have gotten out of control. In court papers arguing against the temporary restraining order, attorneys for the Justice Department argued that the protests have led to criminal activity and that officers had been targeted with improvised explosives, ""commercial grade mortars,"" lasers, and ""balloons filled with paint and other substances such as feces."" They argued that ordering the order wouldn't be possible to implement in practice and would ""improperly bind the hands of law enforcement, including by preventing them from taking appropriate action when individuals are engaging in criminal conduct."" But Simon rejected that reasoning in his order, noting that the city of Portland itself had supported the ACLU in the matter. ""Although the Federal Defendants assert their right to disperse 'violent opportunists,' there is no evidence that any journalist or legal observer — let alone any of the named Plaintiffs — has damaged federal property or acted violently towards federal officers,"" Simon wrote. He added that the government had already ""conceded that they have no such evidence"" during oral argument. ""Indeed, the evidence before the Court shows that journalists and legal observers attend the protests as 'guardians of the public interest,' not as vandals,"" Simon wrote. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who will face Trump during November's presidential election, has criticized the presence of federal officers in Portland. ""Of course the U.S. government has the right and duty to protect federal property,"" Biden said in a statement. ""The Obama-Biden administration protected federal property across the country without resorting to these egregious tactics — and without trying to stoke the fires of division in this country."""

Nathan Bill's Bar & Restaurant, located in Springfield, Massachusetts, had previously banned items such as durags and baggy pants as part of its dress code policy. While the dress code has been posted since the restaurant opened seven years ago, according to reporting from MassLive, it became the center of criticism after a Facebook post with the policy was widely shared among community members. Bishop Talbert Swan, president of the Springfield chapter of the NAACP, tweeted about it around the same time. ""It may as well say, 'WHITES ONLY,'"" Swan tweeted on July 11, with a picture of the restaurant's dress code sign. Swan also pointed out that the restaurant was also the site of an assault on four Black men in 2015. In 2019, a statewide grand jury indicted 12 Springfield police officers, one retired officer, and one former officer, in connection to the incident, according to CNN affiliate WWLP. Following Swan's tweet, local officials and other community organizers gathered Saturday outside the restaurant to protest discriminatory business practices, including the dress code at Nathan Bill's. The restaurant's dress code ""clearly targets communities of color,"" organizers of the peaceful protest wrote on the Facebook event's description. Springfield Councilor At Large Tracye Whitfield, who helped organize the demonstration, wrote on Facebook that they aren't against dress code policies in general, just racist ones. When reached for comment, Whitfield explained that the dress code clearly targeted the ways Black people dress, listing baggy tees, low pants and durags as examples. ""We felt that the sign was racist,"" she told CNN. ""And we're not gonna tolerate any racism, any subliminal messages. We're not going to tolerate it anymore."" Toward the end of the demonstration, restaurant owner Robert Gossman gave a short speech, a video of which was shared on Facebook, announcing the restaurant had taken down the dress code, never to be put up again. ""I am currently ashamed of myself and offer my sincerest apologies for offending and not being more sensitive. I'm terribly upset with myself for not being more cognizant,"" Gossman said at the demonstration. Whitfield, who attended the peaceful protest, confirmed to CNN that Gossman attended the demonstration and gave a speech denouncing the restaurant's previous policy. Gossman took down the policy as soon as it started gaining traction online, she said, and met with the group -- including Whitfield -- privately to apologize as well. He also agreed to fully fund a ""Black Lives Matter"" mural outside Springfield City Hall, Whitfield said. The dress code was first initiated years ago as an attempt to appease the city, which was cracking down on bars to curb violence happening at the time, Gossman told demonstrators. It was used after 10 p.m., when a D.J. and the late night crowd would come in. At the time, he said, the dress code was the norm and the status quo. ""Systemic racism is rampant in our society and following the norm and the status quo, although not intentional, is very much a part of the problem,"" he said. ""I pride myself on not being a sheep following the herd, and I failed myself."" Gossman did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Whitfield said it was ""a great gesture, with meaningful conversations and dialogue."" However, she said, ""this is a message ... if organizations and businesses continue this, we're not going to take it. We're not going to be bartered."""

		Navy works to address racism, sexism, other biases impacting mission readiness with first in-person meetings	","WAVY.com NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) — While Task Force One Navy was launched early this month in an effort to address racism, sexism, and other biases — the first in-person meetings with sailors were held on Wednesday. Some of the topics the task force discussed included racial disparities in the military justice system, advancement opportunities, and diversity within the ranks. An initial report to Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Mike Gilday and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) Russell Smith is due by July 31. The task force’s senior enlisted adviser, Force Master Chief Huben L. Phillips of Commander, Naval Air Forces, met with small groups of sailors and the ship’s crew at Naval Station Norfolk aboard the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis and the destroyer USS Mahan. He also spoke to the crew of the destroyer USS Arleigh Burke over their public address systems, known as the 1MC. “Especially for those who feel disenfranchised and underrepresented, Task Force One Navy will level the playing field for everyone,” Phillips said. “Our recommendations to the CNO and MCPON will ensure that every Sailor, every day will be treated with dignity and respect across the board and afforded equal opportunities of inclusion,” Phillips said. “The task force will not operate in a bubble. We will not make assumptions of your experiences. That is why I’m here today.” Petty Officer 1st Class Jamie Brown aboard Stennis said he’s always wondered if anyone really looked at the surveys that included questions about racism. He said he believes he may have been discriminated against in the past with advancement opportunities. Having Phillips there in person to hear his stories and his shipmates’ stories show that the issue is being taken seriously, he said. “Anything that has a negative impact on the welfare of sailors, that’s one too many, regardless of what it is,” Brown said. During one of the meetings, Phillips asked if anyone had experienced racism while in the Navy. Nearly everyone there raised their hand to say yes, he said. “They did talk about barriers in terms of professional development and retention, why some of their shipmates didn’t stay in the Navy, or reasons why they feel like they didn’t get advanced or opportunities that they didn’t have because of either (their) race or gender,” Phillips said. Improving mentorship, training, and education opportunities are among some of the task force’s other goals. Virtual meetings are being held throughout the fleet to maximize the reach while practicing safety precautions. Phillips said this task force is unlike any other one he’s served on and that everyone in the Navy will see a difference when its work is finished. But he also told Sailors change starts with them. “We’re not going to wait on the task force to tell us how to treat each other. We’ve just got to treat each other with respect,” Phillips said. “We want to start there and we want to be curious about one another, to find out about our differences, because I truly believe it’s our diversity that makes us the strong and mighty Navy that we are today.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

            After being fired for alleged racist comment, ex-Slidell police officer tries to get his job back
        
    ","Slidell Police Department. Slidell Police Department. A former Slidell Police detective is fighting to get his job back after being fired following complaints he used racist language during a 2019 traffic stop. Slidell Police Chief Randy Fandal fired Cyle LaFerrera in January, saying he violated rules governing courtesy and treatment of people in custody, as well as for unbecoming conduct. LaFerrara denied using racist language when he stopped Jarrell Williams in December for running a stop sign, telling the Slidell Civil Service Board last week in an appeal of his firing that he never made any comments about the man's race. He is asking to be reinstated. Williams filed a complaint against LaFerrara shortly after he was issued a traffic citation, alleging that LaFerrara, who was in an unmarked unit and wearing plain clothes, had followed him to a convenience store, calling out ""Get over here now, boy,"" before identifying himself as a police officer. The term ""boy"" is often seen as derogatory towards Black men. He also alleged that LaFerrara told him he had never lost in a court case over a traffic ticket against a Black man — a statement that a witness to the encounter, Jason Patterson, said that he also heard. The Civil Service board will decide later this month whether to uphold or overturn LaFerrara's termination. Testifying before the board July 7, Fandal said that he asked LaFerrara and Williams to take a polygraph test. Fandal testified that he had enough evidence to fire LaFerrara before seeking the polygraph test but that he asked for it to give his officer the benefit of the doubt. The polygraph test showed that Williams was truthful and that LaFerrara was not, Fandal testified. When LaFerrara took the stand, he said that Williams had been traveling north on Carey Street and ran a stop sign, almost side-swiping him. He said he turned around and saw the truck going to the gas station but didn't have time to put on his lights or siren before calling out to stop Williams, who was walking into the store. He denied calling Williams ""boy,"" and said he immediately identified himself as a police officer. ""Mr. Williams says otherwise,"" City Attorney Thomas Schneidau told LaFerrara. ""Is he lying?"" ""He's certainly not telling the truth. I never used that language at any time in my career,"" LaFerrara said. He said that such comments are ""not a part of my vocabulary."" LaFerrara also denied saying that he'd never lost a case to a Black man, but he acknowledged that he had made a comment about Williams' truck during that discussion. ""He said he had deep pockets and would beat me in court,"" LaFerrara said. He testified that he said he'd never lost a traffic case in court and that he had simply said, ""well that's a nice truck you've got there."" LaFerrara also acknowledged that he had asked Patterson, who was using his cell phone to video the stop, whether he liked videoing ""other men."" Williams and Patterson had testified before the board July 6. In an interview, Patterson corroborated Williams' account of what happened, describing the officer as belligerent and angry. Williams declined to comment. According to the internal affairs report, Patterson told officers that he was shocked when he heard LaFerrara say he'd never lost a case to a Black man. Officers asked Patterson if he heard him make any other statements about race. ""No, not that I know of, but for him to say that, that was enough,"" the report quoted Patterson as saying. ""That's like putting it out there, 'look, I'm targeting ya'll and I want you to know this.'"" LaFerrara testified that both he and Williams were ""frustrated"" during the encounter and that there was ""some profanity"" but that he could not recall exactly what curse words were said. He said that Williams had a criminal record, was flagged as a drug dealer and had been leaving a high crime area when he saw him run the stop sign. LaFerrara testified that he should not have ""stooped to his level"" and used profanity. But he said that he let Williams' frustration ""get the better of me."" ""I used curse words, but at no point did I call him any names,"" he testified. Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.

And he wants to continue hard conversations in the community and his department. “Until we confront this thing head-on until we stop looking away until we stop turning our back to what’s right before us, we’re going to find ourselves right back here again,” Ravenell said. At a discussion Saturday between the Black Police Officer Association of Anne Arundel County and the county’s NAACP Youth and College division at the American Legion Post #141 in Annapolis, Ravenell, Sgt. Cam Cooke and Officer Sierra Hillyer — wearing blue shirts reading “Don’t look away” — listened to community members and NAACP youth leaders talk about their experiences with police. Most were not good. Andriesha Burley, who came to the discussion with her husband and children, said she has fears of getting pulled over every time she drives. Marsela Padilla, Vice President of the Anne Arundel County NAACP Youth and College division, said she knows children and teens who fear the police. “It’s really sad,” Padilla said. “It’s heartbreaking that the ones who are supposed to be protecting us are the ones killing us.” To stop over-policing and heal the community’s relationship with the department, Cooke had a solution in one word: courage. Courage from both police officers and members of the community can heal their broken relationship, Cooke said. “If we’re willing to run after a bad guy, we’ve got to use that same courage when we see one of our fellow officers doing something wrong,” Cooke said. “We have to start individualizing this and looking at it, then having the courage to report. We say: ‘I hate cops’ or ‘I don’t like cops’ but we don’t do anything about it.” One of the first steps of the healing courage that can change those situations, Cooke said is to get to know officers who police one’s community by name. “You’ve gotta start somewhere with getting to know police and police getting to know you,” Cooke said. “We need to start having conversations. If one of my officers is not willing to have a conversation and you call and complain, that officer is going to have something to explain right then and there.” Ward 3 alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles suggested the NAACP youth division start a unit for following up on complaints to police of bad policing. “Once you’ve established that sort of checklist and timeline and you stick to that timeline, the word gets out. These people are serious. They’re here to do something and they’re going to make sure it’s done and someone is held accountable,” she said. “It has to be a strategic and organized way of doing this. Otherwise, we’re going to be in the same boat we are now.”"
officer racism,https://www.inquirer.com/life/girls-dance-group-dallas-george-floyd-20200725.html,Girls dance group films video to confront racism and police brutality,"Shantrail White leads a group of girls dressed in black down Commerce Street in downtown Dallas. They pass boarded-up restaurants and stores spray-painted with phrases like “Black Lives Matter,” “No justice, no peace,” and “Now u see us.” Occasionally, they stop in front of one of these spots and raise their fists. It’s early June, the eighth day of protests in Dallas. But this group isn’t participating in those efforts. They’re filming a video in response to police brutality. Except for White, they’re all under the age of 14. White stops the girls and gathers them for a photo. Her shirt says, “I am a Black coach to Black kids on purpose.” White is the director of Elev8ed Elites Dance and Cheer Company, a team that normally practices in a studio in South Dallas. Since March, when the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in this country, they’ve rehearsed via Zoom to practice social distancing. But after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck until he died in May, the team wanted to make a statement. When White met virtually with the girls to see how they were doing, they said Floyd could have been their dad, uncle, or another family member. That’s when the idea for a video came up. “One of the dancers said that she wished we had competition so we could perform our ‘Gun Control’ piece,” White said. Earlier this year, Elev8ed Elites choreographed a dance called “Gun Control” in response to school shootings. The team pulled inspiration from that routine to create a dance for their police brutality video. Jordan Willis, 10, called the filming a day of remembrance for people who were shot by the police. Her mother, Crystal Willis, said that talking to Jordan about heavy topics has gotten easier. Last year, their conversations weren’t as smooth. “She would cry,” Crystal Willis said. “She didn’t want to go to so many places because of [mass shootings]. Now she’s more aware. “She’s still young, so sometimes she doesn’t understand, but my job as a parent is to help her understand. … That regardless of what we’re going through, we should love and treat everybody equally.” Fifty-eight girls dance on the Elev8ed Elites team, but they met downtown in groups of about 10 to practice social distancing while filming the video about police brutality. The team members wore masks, not only to prevent the spread of germs, but also to honor Black Americans who died at the hands of law enforcement. Tamia Franklin, 12, said she was dancing to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “[Police] need to stop killing us,” said Tamia, whose mask featured the name of Eric Garner. In 2014, a New York officer held Garner in a chokehold until he died after police suspected he was selling untaxed cigarettes. Marquita Anderson, Tamia’s mother, told her that before Floyd died on May 25 after repeating that he couldn’t breathe, Garner had previously said, “I can’t breathe.” That has become a prominent phrase in the Black Lives Matter movement. Before they filmed the video, which is now on the team’s YouTube and social media platforms, White made sure all the girls felt included. “We had a conversation to let them know, no matter what’s going on, we’re all dancers,” White said. “Everybody on the team is not Black, and I didn’t want anyone on the team to feel out of place or intimidated.” Some of the dancers have felt like outliers before. When Elev8ed Elites started three years ago, they performed at majorette-style competitions. White wanted the girls to experience competing in environments similar to those of historically Black colleges and universities. After the team traveled to New York in 2018 to tour the Juilliard School and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, they started focusing on ballet, jazz and modern dance. At modern competitions, Elev8ed Elites tends to be the only majority Black team. White said at their first event the girls instantly felt intimidated. “[I told them] we’re equal, no matter what,” White said. “We’ll get a fair chance, no matter what.” Zaria Fisher, 10, has been dancing with the team for two years. When they filmed the video, her mask featured the name of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by a Louisville Metro police officer in March. Zaria is the youngest of four siblings, so her mother, Tori Sears, is no stranger to the talk. “I always tell them, ‘We’re Black,’” said Sears, whose eldest son is 18. “We don’t have the same privileges as others.” After filming on Commerce Street, the girls walked in pairs to get shots in front of Renaissance Tower and on the red line DART train. White set the video to “Unholy War” by Jacob Banks. She chose the song because Banks’ music addresses societal issues. Just four days earlier, White had brought some of the dancers to the same spot on Commerce Street to see the aftermath of the protests. Co-captain Reign Villegas, 13, was disturbed after Floyd’s death. “She understands what happened. What she doesn’t understand is why it happened,” said Tracey Villegas, Reign’s mother. “For a long time [she] didn’t like her kinky, curly hair. ... For her to embrace who she is now and then see something like that — it hurt her.” Villegas, who identifies as Black and Hispanic, said that since Reign joined the team, her confidence has increased significantly. She attributes a lot of that change to White’s guidance. “She’s not just a dance coach, she’s a mentor for the team,” said Anderson, who pulled Tamia from another team to join Elev8ed Elites. “She has them learning about colleges; she’s promoting self-esteem. She’s about developing the total dancer.”"

Portland police released audio of Jackson’s statements and identified the officer in it as Officer Jakhary Jackson. “Officer Jackson talks about being a black police officer working at the demonstrations in Portland, Oregon,” police wrote with the video. You can watch it here: Officer Jackson talks about being a black police officer working at the demonstrations in Portland, Oregon. pic.twitter.com/ZtIjQ7AMaO In addition, a local news station posted a lengthy video of Jackson’s comments, quoting him as saying of why he wanted to become a police officer: “I wanted to make the most out of my life … just hearing that call come out over the radio and you know people are in trouble and need help. You could change people’s lives … just by giving somebody a hug that is having the worst day of their life.” He spoke at a police briefing. What it's like to be a Black officer policing Portland protests | Raw interviewOfficer Jakhary Jackson of the Portland Police Bureau offers his perspective as a Black officer in the middle of downtown Portland's nightly protests. ""I got to see folks that really do want change, like the rest of us that have been impacted by racism,"" Jackson said about the early days of the protests. ""And then I got to see those people get faded out by people who have no idea what racism is all about, who never experienced racism."" He said almost invariably every time a person of color tries to speak with him while he's on duty at a protest, a white person steps in to interrupt. ""It says something when you're at a Black Lives Matter protest and you have more minorities on the police side than you do in a violent crowd,"" he said. ""And you have white people screaming at Black officers.'"" He said he's also disgusted by people calling his white fellow officers racists, without knowing anything about them. Jackson was interviewed by Lt. Tina Jones during a press availability that also include Police Chief Chuck Lovell.

I look like someone these people would call the police on. I have been when I was young, and I got jumped by a group of white people and me putting this uniform on does not erase that history that I have.” I’ve seen folks that really do want change like the rest of us that have been impacted by racism. And then I got to see those people get faded out by people who have no idea what racism is all about, never experienced racism, that don’t even know the tactics they’re using are the same tactics that were used against my people. And they don‘t even know the history. They don’t know what they’re saying. As someone who graduated from PSU with a history degree, it’s actually frightening. I’m cool with people who feel like they want to help a movement but then when you go to a gentrified community, and one of the first pictures I saw of one of the businesses that was looted, was a black-owned business, they’re not even from here, they don’t even know what they’re doing. It’s divisive. It’s hurting the community. And I mean I saw that press conference. Clearly the community wasn’t happy with that and they even asked for the violence to stop. And they’re still coming out and having these violent interactions with other citizens, the police, and at some point you ask what is the end goal? Bloody Sunday, Selma, those folks marched because they wanted the right to vote, and they were beaten in the streets to have rights they were told they couldn’t have because they were not even human and then have folks scream and yell that there were being peaceful protests but they weren’t peaceful because it was violent. I actually had a cousin who went to one of the marches, and he left and he said this has turned into something else, this is weird, so when an African-American male is marching and then leaving, like I said, it’s been very eye opening. It says something when you’re at a Black Lives Matter protest, and you have more minorities on the police side than you have in a violent crowd, and you have white people screaming at black officers, ‘You have the biggest nose I’ve ever seen.’ You hear these things, and you go, are these people going to say something to these people. Having people telling you what to do with your life, that you need to quit your job, that you’re hurting your community, and they’re not even part of the community. Once again, you have a privileged white person telling a person of color what to do with their life and you don’t even know what I’ve dealt with. These white officers you’re screaming at, you don’t know them. You don’t know anything about them. I’ve been called on calls the n word I can’t even count the times since I’ve been a police officer and have white officers jump in to defend me and me telling them to ignore it and them being absolutely shocked and they get to see it so when you’re standing on the line and they’re getting called those names and they’re getting accused of being racist when you’ve seen those officers helping people of color – getting blood on them, trying to save someone’s life who’s been shot, gang violence, domestic violence – and you see them and they’re truly trying to help save someone’s life and then they’re turned around and called a racist by people who’ve never seen anything like that. I have had great conversations. I met two young brothers literally after I’d take explosive, been hit with a full beer can, taken a rock in my chest, a frozen water bottle had hit me, I met two young brothers cleaning up the street. They had garbage bags, and they were just running and cleaning up. A few of us from my team went over and, I had to shake their hands I was so moved by that, so impressed. They said, ‘We’re from here, this is our city. I don’t understand why people are coming here and destroying it.’ PPB Officer Jakhary Jackson hangin’ out with Kyle, a homeless vet, at NE Killingsworth x Lombard.

Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com CLAYTON — A high-ranking Black police officer passed over for St. Louis County police chief this spring has filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination, his lawyer said Friday. But the St. Louis County counselor has accused the officer’s lawyer of trying to extort $3.5 million from the county by trying to resolve the case quietly so it would not become a problem for County Executive Sam Page in the Aug. 4 Democratic primary for county executive. Lt. Col. Troy Doyle was one of eight candidates, and the only Black candidate, who applied to replace Chief Jon Belmar, who retired effective April 30. Doyle had been the choice of several community leaders in the county who wanted him to be the department’s first Black chief. But after a series of closed-door interviews with each candidate, the Board of Police Commissioners on March 19 voted 5-0 to select Capt. Mary Barton, commander of the West County Precinct as the department’s first female police chief. Doyle was detached from the department for most of 2019 to help reform the county jail after a series of inmate deaths. On June 29, Page announced that Doyle would be the department’s liaison to consultants who would review the police department’s practices. A week later, on July 6, attorney Jerome Dobson sent a voice message to Page’s chief of staff, Winston Calvert, telling him that he intended to file the complaint before the Aug. 4 Democratic primary for county executive but wanted the county to have an opportunity to resolve the case. Page’s office shared a copy of the voicemail with the Post-Dispatch. Dobson said he wanted a meeting soon: “I realize we’re operating within a fairly tight time frame as to when the primary is taking place.” In a letter to Dobson on Wednesday, County Counselor Beth Orwick wrote: “Recently, I attended a meeting organized by you in which you threatened to file and make public a charge of discrimination. You threatened to file the charge with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights and EEOC (hereafter, together, the ‘MCHR’) if St. Louis County did not pay you and your client, Lt. Col. Troy Doyle, $3.5 million prior to the upcoming primary election. Please understand that St. Louis County will not be effectively extorted into paying money in exchange for your agreement not to disrupt the upcoming election.” She added: “Specifically, at our meeting, you demanded $3.5 million from St. Louis County to prevent you from filing and making public the MCHR charge of discrimination before the upcoming election and you demanded that the money be paid within 16 days. You offered that if the County paid you and your client $3.5 million, you would hide the documents ‘in your desk drawer,’ and that ‘nobody would know’ about the complaint.” Dobson called the claims of extortion “nonsense,” and said his reaching out to the county was an invitation to settle before going public with the accusations, not a case of extortion. “I think it’s very telling when we’re accusing the county of discriminating against Doyle because of his race, the only response they make is to attack his lawyer,” Dobson said Friday night. “They make no effort to rebut these allegations.” A report by KSDK-TV (Channel 5) said Dobson summarized the complaint for a reporter, but did not share a copy. In the complaint, Dobson told KSDK, Doyle alleged Page had him interview with two police board members in late 2019 before Page nominated them to the board. Doyle said Page told him several times that he was Page’s pick for chief but that some “powerful people with a lot of money” said they did not want Doyle to become chief because he is Black. Page told Doyle that he was getting resistance from the St. Louis Police Foundation about his being selected as chief because he is Black, and Page told Doyle he was having trouble raising funds from big corporate donors. Doug Albrecht, chairman of the St. Louis Police Foundation, countered Friday that the foundation did not push back on picking Doyle as chief. “The mission of the St. Louis Police Foundation is to support the rank and file of both the St. Louis County and the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Departments with equipment, services and other resources that they request,” Albrecht said in a statement. “As a 12-year-old organization, we have not and never will get involved in hiring and personnel issues.” While Page has said he doesn’t control the police board, Doyle said Page told him that it “does what I tell them to do,” Dobson told KSDK. Page said in a statement: “Troy Doyle was my choice for chief. The commissioners, whose independence is why I nominated them, chose someone else.” Shortly after the KSDK story was posted online, Mark Mantovani, one of three candidates challenging Page in the Democratic primary, released a 350-word statement saying he “was saddened to learn of the allegations of discrimination” leveled by Doyle, adding, “if there was discriminatory conduct, it must be condemned.” County Assessor Jake Zimmerman, another candidate, said via Twitter: “Today’s allegations by Col. Doyle are incredibly disturbing. The people of St. Louis County deserve answers and accountability. As for Sam Page, he needs to stop trying to tell everyone what he thinks they want to hear. What we need is the truth.” Taylor Harris of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

Lt. Mary Barton was selected by the police board a week after their last public listening session. Barton, commander of the department’s West County precinct, was selected from a field of eight applicants for the position. The list of officers who want to replace Jon Belmar includes three lieutenant colonels and five captains. The search is underway because of the Chief Jon Belmar is retiring on April 30 after a six-year tenure. St. Louis County Police Lt. Col.

sheriff racism,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Move-to-scale-back-Sheriff-s-Office-power-heads-15428267.php,Move to scale back Sheriff's Office power heads to voters,"SEATTLE (AP) — The Metropolitan King County Council voted this week to scale back the autonomy of the county sheriff, moving to make the position appointed, instead of elected, and to give the council the ability to reduce the scope of the Sheriff’s Office. Both changes will be sent to voters as separate ballot measures in November, The Seattle Times reported. Voters will decide whether to make the sheriff appointed and whether to allow the County Council to spell out the specific duties of the sheriff. Council member Girmay Zahilay framed the changes as a response to the protests against police brutality and systemic racism that have roiled the country for nearly two months. “They have all been saying one central message and that is that we need a new system of public safety, Zahilay said. “That kind of big, bold fundamental change I don’t think we can rely on just a sheriff’s department that’s independently elected that we can’t truly oversee.” Council members Kathy Lambert and Pete von Reichbauer voted against both measures and Council member Reagan Dunn voted against the appointed sheriff measure and was excused for the other. The council is nonpartisan, but all three “no” votes have previously identified as Republicans, while all six “yes” votes have identified as Democrats. From 1969 until 1996, the King County executive appointed the county sheriff. Since then, voters have chosen the sheriff every four years. Earlier this year, King County’s Charter Review Commission, a 23-member citizen board, overwhelmingly recommended returning the sheriff to an appointed position, arguing that it would improve the public’s ability to hold the sheriff accountable between elections."

			Lawsuit alleges Adams County sheriff retaliated against former deputies over political campaign, violated Constitutional rights		

	
	","GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. Days after taking office in 2019, Adams County Sheriff Richard Reigenborn forced four senior members to resign because they’d supported his opponent in the sheriff’s race — then he filled the positions with his less-qualified friends and supporters, according to a lawsuit filed earlier this month by those four former sheriff’s deputies. Former Chiefs Timothy James Coates and Gene Claps, along with former Captain Mark Mitchell and former Commander Kevin Currier  filed the lawsuit July 1 against Reigenborn and the Adams County Sheriff’s Office, alleging Reigenborn violated their rights to free speech and due process when he told them to resign or be fired one week after he took office after winning in an upset. “Literally dumped out on the curb after a 29-year career with no explanation, no anything,” Mitchell said in an interview Thursday, describing how he had to call his wife for a ride home from outside the sheriff’s office. A spokesman for the sheriff’s office declined to comment for this story because of the pending lawsuit. All four plaintiffs supported Reigenborn’s Republican opponent in the sheriff’s race, incumbent Michael McIntosh, according to the lawsuit, by donating to his campaign and publicly backing him. They also withdrew support from the Fraternal Order of Police Colorado Lodge 1, where Reigenborn served in various leadership roles for years. In individual meetings on January 15, 2019, Reigenborn, who ran as a Democrat, told the four that he wanted to “take the agency in a different direction” by making “cultural changes” designed to “get the troops in line,” according to the lawsuit, brought through law firm Rathod Mohamedbhai. He refused to explain what that direction was, Mitchell said, adding that over his career he’d worked for four different sheriffs, both Republicans and Democrats, and “politics never entered the picture.” “To say that we couldn’t fit with the new direction, without us even knowing what it was, is mind-boggling,” Mitchell said. All four men resigned from the sheriff’s office in lieu of termination in order to keep their retirement benefits, according to the lawsuit. “I dedicated my entire life to Adams County,” Coates said, adding later that the forced resignation has created a major financial loss. “It’s very painful to suddenly find yourself on the curb, and in my case I cannot get another police job; I’m too old.” Reigenborn abolished existing sheriff’s department policies the day he took office and replaced them with his own policies that gave him sole authority to make hiring, promotion and firing decisions, according to the lawsuit. The new sheriff then hired or promoted at least five of his friends and supporters, according to the lawsuit, which alleged the new hires were less qualified for the jobs than those the sheriff ousted. Michael Bethel was hired as a division chief on Jan. 22, 2019, according to a roster of sheriff’s employees. Bethel was fired from the Pueblo Police Department in 2006 after a sex tape surfaced that included him, his wife and a man with a long-criminal history, The Denver Post reported in 2015. He was acquitted of criminal charges in connection with the sex tape’s discovery and later won $20,000 in a federal lawsuit accusing Pueblo police leadership of discriminating against him because of his sexual preferences. Bethel later became chief of Rocky Ford, where his son served as an officer despite criminal convictions — some while he was a juvenile — that included use of a gun while drunk, careless driving and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to prior The Denver Post reports. Division Chief William Dunning was hired in May 2019. He’d previously left the sheriff’s office in the mid-1990s and had been working as a RV salesman before he was hired back into top police leadership by Reigenborn, according to the lawsuit. Dunning was initially hired as a civilian and has since been re-certified as a law enforcement officer, according to the sheriff’s office. Dunning and Bethel could not be reached for comment Thursday; a spokesman for the sheriff’s office said they could not comment due to the pending litigation. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages, but Mitchell said he hopes to also ensure others in the department are not deprived of due process in the future. “I would like a decision to be made that career employees have some type of due process,” he said, “and that an elected official cannot just walk in and do what happened to us.”"
sheriff racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/nyregion/ny-back-the-blue-lives-matter-rallies.html,‘Blue Lives Matter’ and ‘Defund the Police’ Clash in the Streets,"A recent number of pro-police rallies have led to fights and arrests as civilian New Yorkers turn on one another over their view of the N.Y.P.D. Clashes between protesters and the police were familiar sights in the days after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer. But a new kind of unrest has emerged in recent days: confrontations between New Yorkers who support law enforcement and those who are pressing for an overhaul of the Police Department. There have been raw encounters in Brooklyn, Queens and in Manhattan, as civilian groups identifying themselves as pro-police have led marches in support of the men and women in blue. The pro-police rallies also attract counterprotesters. Violent clashes and arrests have played out this month as unsettling images of civilian-versus-civilian rage echo back to past periods of racial violence in the city. New Yorkers are shouting, not at police officers, but over their shoulders, at one another. Diane Atkins, a Bay Ridge resident, attended pro-police events in Brooklyn on a Saturday and a Sunday earlier this month. “We wanted to stand up for our police officers,” Ms. Atkins said. “These are everyday New Yorkers who could be your friends, family and neighbors.” Most of the pro-police events have been neighborhood-based and organized by local residents, using Facebook and other social media outlets to gain traction. Others have been co-organized by local political groups, such as the Brooklyn Conservative Party, though most organizers try to refrain from discussing politics at their rallies. The crowds, which are overwhelmingly white, have been a mix of retired officers, their friends and family and other attendees who have said they are rallying support for law and order. Many law enforcement supporters feel local officers have been wrongly vilified since Mr. Floyd’s death. The rise of pro-police rallies is also a reaction to legislative efforts to shrink the Police Department. But the rallies, often known as “Back the Blue” or “Blue Lives Matter” events, have been met by Black Lives Matter backers — racially diverse groups of protesters who are outraged at gatherings that they see as undermining their own cause. “For pro-cop rallies to come down into the streets and yell ‘white lives matter’ or ‘blue lives matter,’ it almost takes away from the conversation,” said 18-year-old Abdullah Akl, who helped organize a counterprotest in Bay Ridge. “We aren’t fighting against individual police, we are fighting against the institution as a whole and all the racism practices within.” Organizers of counterprotests have said that they intend their demonstrations to be “a peaceful, nonviolent show of opposition.” But quelling public anger has proved to be difficult for both sides. Earlier this month in Brooklyn, in the Dyker Heights and Bay Ridge neighborhoods, hundreds turned out for pro-police rallies that were interrupted by protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement, and tensions quickly escalated in confrontations largely split along racial lines. At the rally in Bay Ridge, pro-police participants waved American and Thin Blue Line flags and election signs for President Trump. Counterprotesters arrived with Black liberation flags and Black Lives Matter banners. Fists and insults flew even as police officers stood between the two groups. Several people were seen being taken away by officers. The police later said two people were arrested in Bay Ridge, one for throwing a helmet into a crowd and the other for attempted assault. Days later, a more violent clash took place on the Brooklyn Bridge. A march of clergy to promote peace was joined by a group of off-duty police officers heading to City Hall Park. Black Lives Matter protesters planned to meet the march halfway. Before the two groups could face off, a few dozen on-duty officers halted the Black Lives Matter protesters. Again, violence broke out, but this time solely between police and Black Lives Matter protesters. When a protester was being arrested on the bridge, a woman attacked officers with a cane, the police said. Among the targets were Terence A. Monahan, the Police Department’s chief of department and top uniformed officer, who sprained a finger. Other officers bled from head injuries, and several protesters were injured. The police said 36 people were arrested. The incidents have each been separate, without a single group organizing all the various “Blue Lives” events, but they share a frustration with the criticism of police behavior and tactics and the calls to defund the police. The smartphone videos filmed at the events and shared on social media tend to focus on the loudest and most volatile voices in attendance, but others have quietly sought to mobilize backing for law enforcement. Mary Ziegler, 43, who lives in Burnt Hills, N.Y., near Schenectady, created a Facebook group to rally support for the police. In a little over a month, the group has grown to over 9,000 members from across the country. “I would say this movement to ‘Back the Blue’ was galvanized when calls to defund and abolish the police became a very real force in this country,” Ms. Ziegler said in an email. She recently created a Facebook event to organize a pro-police rally in Albany next month. President Trump has attacked calls to defund the police, calling the demand a fad. And earlier this month, he criticized Mayor Bill de Blasio for allowing “Black Lives Matter” to be painted on the street outside Trump Tower. On Twitter, Mr. Trump said the painted motto will “further antagonize New York’s Finest.” It may have instead inspired them to create their own message: Last week, two police advocacy groups called for a “Blue Lives Matter” painting on a street near 1 Police Plaza in Lower Manhattan. Some pro-police rally attendees insist that their mission is not to antagonize Black Lives Matter protesters. At a recent police rally in Staten Island, Scott LoBaido, 55, told participants the message should be kept positive. “I emphasized if you’re going to spew anti-B.L.M. rhetoric, that will not be tolerated at this rally,” he said. And not everyone in pro-police circles favors the rallies. The Brooklyn Young Republican Club turned down an invitation to the rally in Dyker Heights, according to Joel Acevedo, 25, the president of the organization. “Good police do not need defending,” Mr. Acevedo said. “You can be pro-police and still support accountability to a police system that perpetuates inequities in Black communities. They’re not mutually exclusive.” The mere presence and timing of the nascent movement — and the “Blue Lives” language — has upset protesters calling for overhaul of policing. “The logic is nonsense,” said Noah Weston, 35, an activist from Bay Ridge who attended two pro-police rallies as a counterprotester. On Saturday, he was treated at an emergency room after someone kicked him in the groin. “Blue is their uniform, and they can take it off,” he said. “But Black people can’t stop being Black at their leisure.” Protesters who want to defund the police said they plan to disrupt future pro-police rallies and are training their members on how to respond to an angry reception. Some who attended recent counterprotests said police officers were aggressive toward Black Lives Matter protesters while being lenient with pro-police attendees when trying to intervene during confrontations. Joseph Imperatrice, 35, the founder of the group Blue Lives Matter-NYC, attended the pro-police march in Bayside, Queens, in mid-July where violent confrontations with Black Lives Matter protesters erupted. The consistency of counterprotests and altercations at pro-cop rallies has made Mr. Imperatrice cautious. “That doesn’t mean I won’t go,” Mr. Imperatrice said. “But I’ll definitely think twice.”"

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Investigators released new evidence and surveillance photos Friday that places an attorney suspected of killing a lawyer in California at the time of the murder. San Bernadino homicide detectives probing the death of lawyer Marc Angelucci received new information placing the now-deceased suspect, Roy Den Hollander in California on July 11 when the fatal shooting occurred. Investigators say that on July 7, Den Hollander arrived at the San Bernardino train station and rented a car. Four days later, Den Hollander drove his rental car to Angelucci’s house, where he shot and killed him. This July 11, 2020 surveillance photo provided by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department shows who is believed to be Roy Den Hollander, passing through Union Station in Los Angeles. (Courtesy of San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department via AP) Hollander immediately fled the area in his rental car and boarded a train at Union Station in Los Angeles and left California, police said. The information emerged as authorities worked with the FBI in Newark to investigate a separate shooting at U.S. District Judge Esther Salas' home on July 20, that killed her 20-year-old son and critically injured her husband. Den Hollander, 72, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in New York’s Sullivan County just a day after the shooting at the Salas' residence. Judge Salas presided over a gender-equity lawsuit that Den Hollander filed in 2015, where his client, a young woman from New Jersey, wanted to register for a potential military draft. He later withdrew as the lawyer in the case after being diagnosed with cancer. Meanwhile, Angelucci, a men's rights attorney, was victorious in a similar lawsuit filed in California. Den Hollander and Angelucci were also both associated with the National Coalition for Men (NCFM). Den Hollander described himself as an “anti-feminist” attorney who filed unsuccessful lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of “ladies night” promotions at bars and nightclubs, sued Columbia University for providing women’s studies classes, and sued news organizations over what he said was biased coverage. In more than 2,000 pages of often misogynistic, racist writings posted online, Den Hollander had sharply criticized Salas and other female judges. He also wrote about wanting to use the rest of his time on earth to “even the score” with his perceived enemies, using “cowboy justice.” Authorities say a package addressed to Salas along with a photograph of New York Chief Judge Janet DiFiore were among some of the objects found with Den Hollander's body. Both the Salas home and Angelucci were targeted by a gunman posing as a FedEx delivery driver, police said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

sheriff racism,https://www.nj.com/news/2020/07/nj-attorney-general-opposes-calls-to-defund-the-police-he-says-more-spending-is-needed.html,Defund the police? N.J. attorney general says more spending is needed.,"New Jersey’s top law enforcement official said the state should be spending more, not less money to improve policing, as activists nationwide push cities to divert money from departments in the wake of George Floyd’s death. “The challenge when I hear ‘defund the police’ is: I need more funding,” state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Wednesday during a webinar on police reform. Beefing up training was more important than ever, he said, especially when it came to preparing cops to interact with people having psychiatric episodes. “Immediately withdrawing these types of resources from law enforcement puts them in an untenable position,” he said, at least until the state improved its mental health care and created other agencies to respond to residents in crisis. At the same time, Grewal said the state needed to embrace reforms to combat a “national systemic racism pandemic.” The comments came as the State Police face new questions about the shooting death of an unarmed man who had talked about being possessed and having paranormal experiences, and after New Jersey’s largest city moved to shift more than $11 million out of its public safety budget. Grewal was joined on the webinar by J. Scott Thomson, the former head of Camden’s police department, and Vanita Gupta, who used to lead the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. Thomson highlighted Camden’s restrictive force policy, and he said increasing their department’s size ultimately helped lower crime. He agreed hiring more cops was not the way to solve complex problems like homelessness, but he said officers were currently the only people who could quickly help a 911 caller in the middle of the night, regardless of the emergency. Gupta highlighted reforms she’s pushed for in Congress, including a national use-of-force standard and increased federal oversight of local departments. Years of poor funding for schools and health care had not only hurt Black communities, she said, but put unnecessary pressure on cops facing the poverty and crime those failed systems can create. Grewal also highlighted ongoing reforms. New Jersey will soon require all cops to be licensed and is rolling out a database to allow the public to track how local cops use force, and officials are asking for public feedback to re-write the rules for when officers are allowed to use pepper spray, guns and other types of force. Grewal recently endorsed releasing cops’ disciplinary records, and he is fighting police unions in court to release names of some disciplined officers. Our journalism needs your support.

sheriff racism,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/07/24/un-human-rights-office-calls-us-police-limit-use-force/,U.N. human rights office calls on U.S. police to limit use of force,"The United Nations human rights office on Friday called on U.S. security forces to limit their use of force against peaceful protesters and journalists, as clashes between federal agents and demonstrators continue in Portland, Ore. “Peaceful demonstrations that have been taking place in cities in the U.S. such as Portland really must be able to continue without those participating in them and also the people reporting on them, the journalists, risking arbitrary arrest or detention, being subject to unnecessary disproportionate or discriminatory use of force or suffering other violations of their rights,” Liz Throssell, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights office, said at a news conference in Geneva, emphasizing that officers must be “properly and clearly identified.” Anti-racism protests have rocked Portland for about two months, since a wave of demonstrations erupted across the United States in response to the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. President Trump, eager to quell the unrest, deployed federal forces to Portland, sparking outrage among city officials who oppose the move. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who was among those tear-gassed by federal agents there this week, has called the officers Trump’s “personal army.” But Trump has defended his decision to send federal forces to the city, claiming unrest in Portland is “worse than Afghanistan.” He has also said he would consider sending federal forces to other U.S. cities, including Chicago and New York. Scenes from Portland in recent days, showing federal forces at times violently clashing with protesters, have provoked outcry across the nation. Inspectors general from the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday they would investigate federal agents’ conduct in Portland and Washington, D.C., where clashes occurred earlier this summer. And U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon on Thursday barred officers “from arresting, threatening to arrest, or using physical force” against journalists or other legal observers without probable cause. The U.N.'s concerns mirrored those of activists in the United States. “There have been reports that peaceful protesters have been detained by unidentified police officers and that is a worry because it may place those detained outside the protection of the law and may give rise to arbitrary detention and other human rights violations,” Throssell said. Recent protests in the United States have sparked a global reckoning over racism and police violence. U.N. Human Rights Council to turn attention on ‘systemic’ racism in United States In June, the U.N. Human Rights Council decried violent police tactics and called for an inquiry into systemic racism in the United States. The resolution came after an unusual debate on “systemic racism, police brutality and violence against peaceful protests” in the United States, requested by all 54 countries in Africa. It was adopted unanimously by the 47 countries that belong to the council. “It is important to show Africa … the Human Rights Council has heard the plight of African and people of African descent calling for equal treatment and application of equal rights for all,” Dieudonné W. Désiré Sougouri, Burkina Faso’s ambassador to the United Nations, said when presenting the resolution. The United States withdrew from the council in 2018.

Until the late 1960s, Post reporters never questioned why infractions such as loitering, talking loudly and jaywalking regularly led to fatal police shootings of black men. More recently, the Editorial Board has praised the police department for putting more officers in Ward 8. The board has suggested increasing mandatory minimum sentences for gun offenses, a policy at the root of mass incarceration. In recent months, The Post endorsed a D.C. Council candidate who attacked his opponent’s call to divert police funding to social services. The Post’s recent attention to the systemic racism of policing must be accompanied by a reckoning with its history of upholding police and criminalizing black people. Read more letters to the editor.

We have no problems. We have a very good police chief who does a good job. Leave things alone. We don’t need the outside Black Lives Matter people coming around here stirring up troubles. If the mayor has any brains, he will keep them out of here. The police are doing a good job here. I support the police. Leave it like that. Thank you for Crosby, Armstrong columns: I just want to say how happy I am to see Denise Crosby and Rick Armstrong back writing their columns. They are both just outstanding columnists. Copley developers inept: City hall has done it again. They’ve anointed a group of developers for Copley that are so inept that they can’t even obtain commercial financing. By default, the city is foolish enough to turn my hard-earned tax money into a bank and loan these people over $1 million. Who brought these people to the bargaining table? When will these gifts end? After their luxury office furniture is purchased. With city hall in charge, what could go wrong? Aurora loans: I see that we have a bunch of amateur bankers on the Aurora city council. I see that they also flunked all their banking courses in college. How else do you explain these dweebs giving a $1.2 million loan to the mayor’s friends? This kind of arrangement could never have been approved by a commercial bank. With these developers too lame to get conventional financing, I smell a big embarrassment for the city council. Don’t vote for Democrats: In this next election, even if you don’t like Donald Trump, you should vote for Donald Trump. Don’t vote for these Democrats. They’re Marxists and socialists. They’re everything that destroys this country. They don’t have to tear down monuments, statutes, and loot photographs from places because it offends people. Come on. You look at them, and you don’t like them then turn your face. You learn from it. You don’t tear it down and destroy it. It’s history. It’s part of this country like it or not. No leadership from White House: What is wrong with the leadership coming out of the White House? Especially the president of the United States of America. He seems to be off the damn rails. Folks, you can’t make this ... up. You see it every day. I don’t know how a person in their right mind can support this president. He’s doing nothing but ridiculing people he doesn’t like or speak out against him. Not a good idea to send kids back to school: Parents shouldn’t send their kids back to school. They’ll come back with the coronavirus. They just spread germs everywhere. It’s not safe. Have you ever watched 10-year-olds play? They’ll lick someone’s shoe on a dare. I think they should have e-Learning days and in-person learning days, so the schools can clean every other day. Trump battered, bullied: I wonder how Joe Biden would do, and how Nancy Pelosi would do, and how Adam Schiff would do if there was constant battering, constant bullying, constant aggression against them like they do to Trump. Mayor DeBlasio and Al Sharpton painting that Black Lives Matter on the street in front of the Trump Hotel was nothing more than an in-your-face, nasty, bullying tactic to denigrate the president. I think the Democrats better be careful because it’s the Democrats who are creating a rift between people in the United States. Those of us who were very sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter situation for many years are losing interest in it. We’re upset that you are tearing down monuments and our history. Trump’s COVID hoax talk is dangerous: If I were the family of this kid who died from the coronavirus because he believed it was a hoax, I would go after the Trump administration. I would go after this egotistical dummy of a leader we have who said it was a hoax. This is what our kids are listening to. You’re talking about role models. This man isn’t a good role model for a dog. Biased media: There is a sign on Somonauk Road a couple of miles outside of Cortland. It says, “Stop Trump and the Nazis, Black Lives Matter.” If I put a sign in my yard that says, “Stop Joe Biden and the Communists and the Fascists,” do you think my sign would be up for a minute? I couldn’t say White Lives Matter because that would be racist. Apparently, illegal immigrants and everyone else can denigrate white people, and we can’t do a darn thing about it. Please. Let’s have some responsible reporting. We have three parties in this country and none of them are good. The very worst is not really a political party. It’s a quasi-political party. It’s the mainstream media. Mainstream media. The biased, racist media. Consider defunding the military: Racial discomfort was always apparent when President Obama met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. For those who want to defund our police, how about also defunding our military. Think about it. Justice system makes no sense: What sense does this nation’s justice system make? Mass murderers Ted Bundy and John Gacy were executed. But Chicago’s killer of eight student nurses, Richard Speck, was spared execution. Wallace didn’t find the noose: Regarding the July 15 Speak Out “Attention grab, Bubba Wallace driving in NASCAR was a great idea.” The speaker said Bubba (Wallace) found the noose. That is untrue. It was found by another driver who reported it. Only then did Bubba find out about it. I know Speak Out is opinion and that’s OK. When a statement is made that is untrue, that should be noted even if the opinion is continued. POTUS only concerned about his re-election: It just keeps getting crazier every day with this president. I hate to keep talking about him, but he is the focus of attention right now. We’re in a bad place in this country. If you are part of his base and you can’t see what’s going on, it’s true that he has a cult-like following. Anyone in their right mind can see he is not fit to be in that office. I can’t think anything he’s done right. Donald Trump doesn’t want you to know how many people are dying in the hospital. He thinks it damages his chances for re-election. This is what it’s all about. To him, it’s all about being in power and in control. He needs to be president of all of us, not just 30% of us. Buy Goya products: An American company is getting punished for visiting the White House. The president of Goya products talked to Trump just like he did when Obama was president. Now, people are boycotting his company. This hatred has to stop. The last time I looked it was still the land of the free. You want to act like China, then move to China. People are sick of this hate. Shame on you. You need Jesus. Please, everybody, buy Goya products. Airlines shouldn’t get to sell every seat: I don’t understand the airline situation. If people are supposed to be social distancing, and so on and so forth, how can it possibly correct for airlines to sell every seat. It’s a foolish idea. The whole economy is turned half-way upside down. I know the airlines are hurting but to let them sell every seat, you might as well tell the bar owners they can fill every bar stool. I mean, it’s ridiculous. Say no to Goya boycott: The owner of Goya products is now under a boycott for simply talking to and praising President Trump for all he’s done for Hispanics. The left wants to have complete control over our speech and political view. If we don’t go along, they try to ruin you financially. More reason than ever to vote for Trump in November and buy Goya products. Editor’s note: Speak Out is a reader-generated column of opinions.

A little more than a mile away from the spot where 50 or so protesters culminated their BLM-supporting mock funeral in a so-called die-in, the fireworks celebrated police departments from all over Lake County for Police Appreciation Day at the Patrician banquet hall. Schererville officers kept a watchful eye while keeping their distance; one snapped a photo. That the protestors were “dying” — meaning they lay on the ground for eight minutes and 46 seconds in honor of how long it took or George Floyd to die — while law enforcement and its supporters were celebrating was by design, said John Halstead, one of the protest organizers. Though the hearse originally scheduled to lead the procession canceled at the last minute, the group circled the Patrician twice to make its presence known. Halstead said he viewed the law enforcement gathering, in its sixth year, as an “act of aggression” toward people of color. “We say ‘Black lives matter,’ then they say, ‘All lives matter.’ But we know all lives don’t matter until Black lives matter,” Halstead said. Alexia Sotos, of Whiting United Against Racism, reminded the group of the power they’d harnessed through gathering and speaking out against injustice. The Rev. Charles Strietelmeier, who leads the Northwest Indiana Federation, agreed, saying he hasn’t felt this optimistic that race relations could improve since the 1960s. But rallies alone aren't going to do it. “This’ll happen at barbecues. When someone (says something racist), tell them, and if they get offended, it’s because they know they’re wrong,” he said. “We have to make them listen, because when people listen, the violence goes down.” Missie Summers-Kempf, leader of Portage’s Black Lives Matter, said it took awhile for her to learn the violence people of color endure. Raised in a suburb of Milwaukee, Summers-Kempf said she was a gifted student whose mom would get up at 4 a.m. to drive the 90 minutes for her to go to the better school than her siblings got to attend. Her first glimpse, she told the crowd, was at age seven, when a boy named Jason got a toy stuck in her hair. The white adults, not knowing what to do, decided the easiest way to fix the problem was to cut the toy out, she said. The hair hasn’t grown back quite right ever since. ""Every time I brush my hair, I'm reminded of that,"" she said. She too feels that relations are shifting ever-so-slightly for the better, if for no other reason than she can’t bear the reality people of color continue to face. “They were killing Black and brown men, but then they started killing Black and brown women. Please, don’t let them kill me,” she said tearfully. “When I drive and I see a police car behind me, I’m watching them in my rearview mirror, praying they won’t pull me over, instead of watching in front of me. And I’m tired of people telling me to ‘Go home’ when I’m two blocks from my house. “When you see me, stop and talk to me. Get to know me. And when you see something, say something. We have to speak up against this,” she said. “I can’t continue this struggle alone.” Michelle L. Quinn is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune."
sheriff racism,https://www.nytimes.com/article/portland-protests-explained-protesters.html,"What Do Portland Protesters Want, and How Have the Police Responded?","Eight weeks after the death of George Floyd, here’s a look at why longstanding protests in the city have recently intensified. When a video showing George Floyd’s death in police custody spread across social media, cities and towns nationwide soon erupted in protests against systemic racism and police brutality. But while protests in many places subsided after a few weeks, Portland, Ore., has been holding demonstrations every night since May 29.The arrival of federal forces in the city this month — and concerns they were exceeding their authority and violating protesters’ rights — drew the ire of local officials and reinvigorated nightly demonstrations. With renewed force, marchers have spray-painted the walls of the U.S. District Court building, demanding that federal agents go home. Groups of mothers have banded together, locking arms and chanting: “Feds stay clear. Moms are here.” Early in the protests, protesters broke into the Multnomah County Justice Center and set some of the offices on fire, and the Portland police have reported cases of looting. More recently, demonstrators have thrown rocks and bottles at federal officers. But many have protested peacefully, and Gov. Kate Brown has called the presence of federal agents an “abuse of power.” President Trump has called the demonstrators “anarchists” who “hate” the country, and Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, has blamed Oregon officials for the unrest. Federal officers in military gear … … clouds of tear gas … … crowd control munitions … [shots fired] … and locals who want those officers gone. “What are you guys protecting?” “Get the [expletive] out of our city!” In just over a week, the chaotic scenes in Portland grabbed the nation’s attention and raised questions about whether the U.S. government is exceeding its authority and violating civil rights. The officers came because of an executive order signed by President Trump in late June to protect federal property from destruction. “If we didn’t take a stand in Portland, you know, we’ve arrested many of these leaders. If we didn’t take that stand, right now you would have a problem like — they were going to lose Portland.” So what’s going on here? And what methods are the officers using to protect federal sites? Crowd: “Breonna Taylor!” The protests against racism and police brutality, which started in May, had largely been peaceful and were held across Portland. But after federal officers arrived in the city on July 4, demonstrations became centered around this U.S. District courthouse and this building housing federal agencies. Both are property of the U.S. government. The buildings have clearly been vandalized, and the Department of Homeland Security has a mandate to protect them. That’s usually done by officers from the Federal Protective Service. But on the ground in Portland, we have seen a new task force, including U.S. Marshals … … BORTAC, a unit of Customs and Border Protection … … and a special response team from ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. According to a government memo leaked to The Times, these units are insufficiently trained to perform crowd control. But that hasn’t stopped them from trying. Night after night, videos show these officers emerging from the two federal buildings as protesters draw near. Hundreds of videos reviewed by The Times show that although protesters were antagonistic, officers often responded with disproportionate force. [shouting] They blanketed streets with tear gas. “Are you OK?” They struck protesters with batons … … and used flash bangs, pepper balls and other less-lethal munitions to clear the streets. [chanting] Their actions often appeared to escalate rather than de-escalate matters. And in some instances, they attacked when there was no apparent threat. On July 11, protester Donavan La Bella was at the federal courthouse when an officer appears to have fired at his head in retaliation for tossing a spent tear gas canister. “[expletive] you!” [shot fired] La Bella’s mother told local media he suffered skull fractures and needed surgery. Later that night when field medics sought officers’ help for a wounded protester, they were aggressively cleared away. On July 18, a Navy veteran was batoned and pepper-sprayed in another unprovoked attack. His right hand was broken, and he needs surgery. Sometimes members of the press were hit. “He got shot in the back, obviously, and he’s wearing press —” This photographer, Mathieu Lewis Rolland, told The Times that a volley of 10 projectiles were fired into his back. “Ow, ow, ow!” In the middle of all this, protesters were detained in ways that alarmed civil rights advocates and former Homeland Security officials. “Can your people identify themselves as law enforcement?” On July 15, several federal officers were filmed driving in unmarked vehicles in the blocks around the courthouse. “How are we supposed to know who you are? How are we supposed to know you’re not kidnapping us and you’re civilians kidnapping us?” One protester was detained at this location nearby. “What are you doing?” Federal officers wouldn’t identify themselves … “Use your words!” … but patches on the right and left sides of their uniforms match those used by members of BORTAC, the tactical unit from Customs and Border Protection. They drove the protester away in an unmarked car. D.H.S. says federal officers have made 43 arrests since July 4. Agents do have the authority to make arrests if they believe that a federal crime has been committed, like damaging federal property or attacking officers. Crowd: “Hey, hey, ho, ho, these racist cops have got to go.” In recent days, the controversy mobilized a larger and more diverse crowd of protesters. [chanting] A so-called wall of moms led marches through Portland’s streets and to the federal courthouse where officers cleared them away. The federal presence has also inflamed tensions. Some demonstrators damaged paneling on the courthouse and tried to set them alight. Others threw water bottles and fired fireworks toward the building. On Wednesday, July 22, Portland’s mayor joined the protests and was caught in a cloud of tear gas. “This is a egregious overreaction on the part of the federal officers. This is not a de-escalation strategy. This is flat-out urban warfare.” At around the same time, a Customs and Border Protection plane was spotted circling overhead. C.B.P. officials told The Times it was sending a live video feed of the crowd to law enforcement on the ground. Crowd: “No justice, no peace! Protesters and local officials say this is all a case of federal overreach. Oregon’s attorney general has sued the federal government to stop arresting people. “Gas! Gas! Gas!” The president has doubled down, promising to send more federal officers to cities governed by his political rivals. “Because we’re not going to let New York and Chicago and Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore, and all of these — Oakland is a mess — we’re not going to let this happen in our country. All run by liberal Democrats.” The results could look like a national police force acting under presidential orders, able to ignore local demands and arrest residents. In Portland, it has been a recipe for chaos. [explosion] What started out as a movement for police accountability and racial justice has morphed into a complex mobilization. The protesters’ goals now include defunding the police, addressing income inequality and pushing federal agents out of the city. In Portland, which is one of America’s whitest cities and has a racist history, protesters have maintained a public call for change that has subsided elsewhere in the country. Experts say the protests bring together a coalition of racial justice proponents and anti-fascist advocates, who have long been active in Portland. The groups share some intersecting grievances and common goals, such as cutting police budgets and installing more civilian oversight of the police. Signs such as “White Silence=Violence” and “Black Lives Matter” are widespread, and calls at the demonstrations to address racial inequities persist. One woman held a sign that said: “My Black Child is Watching! #BLM She Will Know Her Life Matters.” Demonstrators have also expressed increasing frustration with the federal presence and the Trump administration. “What is making more people come to the street every night now is the brutalization that’s happening to regular community members at the hands of Portland police and these federal agents,” Jo Ann Hardesty, a city commissioner, said at a news conference. Street protests began four days after the death of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis. As the demonstrations continued and officers used tear gas to disperse crowds, public outrage against aggressive police tactics increased and calls to defund the police escalated. On June 8, after more than a week of large-scale demonstrations involving thousands of marchers, the chief of the Portland Police Bureau stepped down, saying new leadership was needed to rebuild public trust. Shortly after, a federal judge upheld restrictions on tear gas put in place by Mayor Ted Wheeler, barring the use of the chemical agent except when life or safety was at risk. The City Council also passed a budget that would cut $15 million from the police in the upcoming fiscal year, a demand sought by protesters. By late June, the size of protests had diminished significantly. Rose City Justice, a major mobilizing force in Portland, announced plans to pull back on organizing efforts. Nightly marches, numbering in the hundreds, became more decentralized. But after federal agents, including some from the Department of Homeland Security, arrived in July, reports soon emerged that they had forcefully pulled people into unmarked vehicles, injured protesters, and deployed tear gas. Mayor Wheeler, who called the situation “an attack on our democracy.” was tear-gassed with a group of protesters outside the federal courthouse. By the time the federal agents arrived, city leaders said, the situation on the streets had de-escalated. But outrage at the Trump administration’s deployment reinvigorated the daily rallies. The federal agents present in Portland include personnel from the U.S. Marshals and tactical agents from Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in addition to the Federal Protective Service, which was already stationed to protect federal property in Portland. Some of the agents are from a group known as BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s equivalent of a SWAT team, which typically investigates drug smuggling organizations. Oregon has a history of white supremacy. A law passed in 1844 said that any Black person would be “whipped twice a year until he or she shall quit the territory” and leaders also later banned Black people from entering the territory. Some protesters say the state’s deeply racist history is still reflected in Portland’s structures. One protester, Reginald Liggins, who is Black, told The New York Times that he began commuting by bus after being pulled over multiple times by the Portland police without reason. Liza Lopetrone, a veterinary nurse who is white and joined the Wall of Moms protest this week, said she wanted to bring the state’s white supremacist legacy to light. Others were not moved to participate until federal agents entered the city. Christopher J. David, a Navy veteran who was filmed being beaten with a baton by federal officers, had not followed the protests until U.S. agents were deployed. He came to the protests to ask officers about their use of violent tactics against protesters, which he said conflicted with their oath to uphold the Constitution."

			San Jose police chief criticized for tweet that shows guns, rosary, union symbol		

	
	","GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. SAN JOSE – A tweet from San Jose police Chief Eddie Garcia has landed him in hot water with some members of local labor and faith communities. Posted on Wednesday, the tweet highlighted a recent arrest and included a photo of two guns that were seized, along with a rosary and a facemask bearing the logo of the United Farm Workers. “Chief Eddie Garcia tweeting a picture of the UFW facemask and rosary next to images of guns shows great disrespect to our Latino and faith community,” said Darlene Tenes, an event planner in San Jose who has organized three caravans to deliver masks, food and household goods to farm workers during the coronavirus pandemic. “Unfortunately these symbols of faith, hope and struggle have been hijacked by teenage gang members,” she continued, “but it shows great irresponsibility for the chief of police of the 10th largest city in the nation to perpetuate and make people believe otherwise.” Tenes said her cousin, Andy Zermeno, designed the UFW logo, which was based on a drawing of an eagle by Richard Chavez, the brother of late labor leader Cesar Chavez. “The eagle is an inverted pyramid showing the strength of our ancestry,” Tenes said. “The black symbolizes the plight of the farm workers, the red the struggle and the white the hope.” Garcia’s tweet also drew a rebuke from Jon Pedigo, director of advocacy and community engagement for Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County. “I am not sure what the non-gun items have to do with the guns and pistols,” he said in a reply to Garcia’s tweet. “These symbols are sacred and in our current context, putting these items next to the guns only fans the flames of racism.” In a statement Thursday, Garcia said he will be “more thoughtful” about what he shares on social media going forward. “A recent surge of shootings in our gang-impacted neighborhoods included two homicides, one victim being a juvenile,” said Garcia, referring to the shooting death of 15-year-old Uriel Mendiola Zepeda. “Rather than waiting for the next victim, officers are proactively getting these guns out of the hands of those causing violence. “As a Latino and Catholic, I’m offended by the use of sacred items to show gang involvement like the rosary, and the United Farm Workers flag whose rich history we cherish and celebrate,” he continued. “I will be more thoughtful in considering how to depict what we frequently see on the street with the impact imagery can have in perpetuating racial negativity.” Despite the outcry, Garcia had not deleted the tweet as of early Friday afternoon. “After seeing Chief Garcia’s statement about being more careful about what he tweets, I was surprised to see he did not remove the tweet,” Tenes said. “Very disappointing.”"

illegal search,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/satellites-uncover-widespread-illegal-fishing-in-pacific-ocean/ar-BB173YtO,Satellites uncover widespread illegal fishing in Pacific Ocean,"Satellite imagery has dragged ""dark"" fishing fleets out into the light. Orbital observations have revealed extensive illegal fishing of Pacific flying squid (Todarodes pacificus) in the Pacific Ocean around Russia, Japan and North and South Korea in 2017 and 2018, a new study reports. In fact, ""extensive"" may not be a strong enough word. More than 900 vessels of Chinese origin probably violated United Nations sanctions by fishing in North Korean waters in 2017, and another 700 did the same in 2018, the study found. These scofflaw ships likely hauled in more than 176,000 tons (160,000 metric tons) of Pacific flying squid over those two years, a catch worth about US $440 million, study team members said. That's nearly equivalent to the combined T. pacificus catch of Japan and South Korea over the same span. ""The scale of the fleet involved in this illegal fishing is about one-third the size of China's entire distant-water fishing fleet,"" said study co-lead author Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing ocean sustainability via greater transparency. ""It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by vessels originating from one country operating in another nation's waters,"" Park said in a statement. Park and his colleagues tracked fishing activity in the Pacific around the Koreas, Japan and Russia, a big patch of poorly monitored ocean. Many of the vessels plying these waters are dark, meaning they don't publicly broadcast their positions and don't show up in monitoring databases. So the researchers got a bird's-eye view, studying the region using four different types of satellite information. For example, the researchers pored through Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which is designed to help ships keep tabs on traffic in their area and avoid collisions. AIS signals stream continuously from transponders on ships, and these signals are often detected via satellite. But many ships don't beam out AIS signals, and the ones operating illegally are very unlikely to do so. The team also looked at optical imagery gathered by Earth-observing satellites operated by San Francisco-based company Planet. The researchers analyzed wide-field photos captured by Planet's shoebox-sized Dove cubesats, as well as targeted imagery from larger, sharper-eyed SkySats. In addition, Park and his colleagues scrutinized data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard Suomi NPP, a satellite operated jointly by NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. VIIRS can spot brightly lit ships at night, which makes it well suited to hunt squid boats; these vessels usually operate after dark, drawing squid up from the depths with huge banks of very bright lights. The researchers also used synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imagery to hunt for large metal vessels in the region. The team used SAR data from several different satellites: the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1, the Japanese Space Exploration Agency's PALSAR-2, and RADARSAT-2, which is operated by the company Kongsberg Satellite Services. Combining all of this information allowed the team to determine the extent of illegal fishing in the area — something that had never been done on this scale, team members said. ""These novel insights are now possible thanks to advances in machine learning and the rapidly growing volume of high-resolution, high-frequency imagery that was unavailable even a couple of years ago,"" co-author David Kroodsma, Global Fishing Watch research and innovation director, said in the same statement. ""We've shown we can track industrial fishing vessels that are not broadcasting their locations."" The new study, which was published online today (July 22) in the journal Science Advances, suggests that the illegal vessels pose a significant threat to the management of the T. pacificus fishery. That fishery is extremely valuable — T. pacificus is the top seafood by production value in South Korea, and one of the top five seafoods eaten in Japan — and it's on an unsustainable trajectory. Since 2003, reported catches of T. pacificus have dropped by 80% and 82% in South Korean and Japanese waters, respectively, study team members said. ""Global fisheries have long been dominated by a culture of unnecessary confidentiality and concealment. Achieving a comprehensive view of fishing activity is an important step toward truly sustainable and cooperative fisheries management, and satellite monitoring is a key part of the solution,"" co-author  Quentin Hanich, an associate professor at the Australian National Center for Ocean Resources and Security at the University of Wollongong, said in the same statement. ""This analysis represents the beginning of a new era in ocean management and transparency,"" Hanich added. The team also determined that about 3,000 North Korean ships fished illegally in Russian waters in 2018, likely pushed so far afield by competition with the illegal Chinese vessels in their own backyard. Most of the North Korean boats are small and made of wood, and therefore not designed for such long open-ocean voyages. Indeed, hundreds of North Korean fishing vessels have washed up on Japanese and Russian shores in recent years, study team members said. ""The consequences of this shifting effort for North Korean small-scale fishers are profound, and represent an alarming and potentially growing human rights concern,"" study co-author Katherine Seto, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said in the same statement.

illegal search,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shortage-of-key-coronavirus-drug-remdesivir-fuels-black-market-in-india/,Shortage of key coronavirus drug remdesivir fuels illegal market in India,"By Arshad R. Zargar New Delhi — Dinesh's 70-year-old father was admitted to a hospital in Mumbai, India's financial capital, earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. When his condition worsened, doctors prescribed remdesivir, a broad spectrum antiviral medicine cleared for restricted emergency use by several countries, including India. But the hospital had run out of the drug, so doctors asked Dinesh (not his real name, as he wished to remain anonymous) to find his own supply. ""I am glad I could get it on the black market, otherwise I may have lost my father,"" he told CBS News. But finding the drug, one of just a few proven to help COVID-19 patients, wasn't easy. He said he ""ran between drug stores"" and made ""hundreds of phone calls"" before finally securing a course of the medicine — at 10-times the market price. He paid 40,000 Indian rupees ($533) for just one 100 mg dose of the drug, which normally costs only about $66. He bought six of those vials, the dose an adult patient is supposed to receive, forking out a total of 240,000 rupees or about $3,200. That's a price that only a small percentage of people in India could hope to afford. Remdesivir, an anti-viral drug that has been used for years to treat Ebola, has been shown to speed the recovery time for coronavirus patients in a U.S. clinical trial. It works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs to replicate inside human cells. But that success has seen demand surge, and the medicine is in short supply in India, which currently has the world's third-worst COVID-19 epidemic with almost 1.2 million cases and over 28,000 deaths. The demand has created a thriving illegal trade in the drug. ""We had no option but to pay the higher price,"" Delhi resident Pankaj (who also asked that his real name not be used), told CBS News. Three of his family members were hospitalized with COVID-19. One of them, his 52-year-old uncle who has an underlying disease, became severely ill. Doctors put him on remdesivir injections, but after two days the Delhi hospital ran out. ""We first tried buying it from the market but it wasn't available,"" said Kumar. ""But we managed to make contact with a person who arranged it for us at a price of 40,000 Indian rupees (USD 533)."" That's about eight times the official price. ""We didn't even think about the inflated price at that moment… all that was on our mind was to save the life of our patient,"" Kumar told CBS News. His uncle is still in the hospital, but feeling better after the remdesivir injections. Indian authorities have started cracking down on the people behind the illicit market in remdesivir. Last week, police in Mumbai and Hyderabad said they had broken up a ring involving nurses, hospital staff, pharmacy staff and dealers, arresting 14 people in all for selling the drug illegally, at about six times the market price. Police said they also recovered 23 vials of the medicine from those taken into custody. CBS News made contact with several individuals who had helped supply other coronavirus patients or their families with illegally sourced remdesivir. When asked if the drug was available, one of the middlemen said we would have to, ""wait for a couple of weeks, as the police are very active and conducting raids."" The Mumbai arrests involved police posing as customers looking to buy remdesivir, which appeared to be making people in the black market supply chain more cautious. Another source, who works in the pharmacy industry in India, told CBS News that hospital staff had a ""big role to play"" in the illegal sales of the drug. ""They siphon off the supplies to drug stores, who sell them to desperate patients."" The patent on remdesivir is held by the original manufacturer, California-based pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences. In June, the Trump administration struck a deal with Gilead to secure its next three months' worth of remdesivir production (500,000 doses) for U.S. hospitals. The controversial purchase came as the U.S. saw coronavirus cases soar into the millions. America has the worst epidemic on the planet right now, with more than 145,000 deaths confirmed. But the block order left negligible stocks of the life-saving drug for the rest of the world. ""The U.S. is the worst affected country by coronavirus, but that does not give them the right to buy the entire world stock of the drug,"" Dr. Andrew Hill, a senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool's pharmacology department, told CBS News. Even before the U.S. secured virtually all of Gilead's remdesivir stocks, the pharmaceutical company signed licensing agreements in May with nine companies in India, Pakistan, and Egypt to manufacture and distribute generic versions of the drug in 127 countries, ""nearly all low-income and lower-middle income countries, as well as several upper-middle- and high-income countries,"" according to a Gilead statement. But while the deal was signed in May, only three of the nine companies have actually started production of their own versions of the drug. The delay has been due, in large part, to the companies waiting for approvals from respective authorities in their own countries. The three companies now making their own versions of remdesivir are all in India. Cipla, Hetero Labs, and Mylan all started production after the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) approved their drugs for restricted emergency use in COVID-19 patients. A fourth Indian company, Jubilant Life Sciences, has also received approval and is set to begin production soon. Cipla has been selling its remdesivir drug, under the brand name CIPREMI, in India since July 8. One dose sells for a fair 4,000 Indian rupees. ""Given the unprecedented demand for the drug, we have ramped up our capacity and that of our partner network. We aim to supply over 80,000 vials within the first month itself, and expect the demand-supply gap to normalize in the next few weeks,"" Cipla told CBS News. Hetero Labs has launched its drug under the brand name COVIFOR, priced at 5,400 Indian rupees per dose, while Mylan launched its version on Monday, branded as Desrem and priced at 4,800 rupees. It's not clear yet how many doses can be produced by the nine companies in India, Pakistan and Egypt over the next three months. But Hill, of the University of Liverpool, said it will be ""nowhere near enough."" ""There is not enough remdesivir in the world at the moment… and it's a difficult drug to make — it takes time,"" he told CBS News. ""I would say countries should prioritize the use of much cheaper and as effective drug, dexamethasone,"" he said. Given the limited production thus far, all the three companies in India are distributing their products directly to hospitals in a bid to prevent illegal sales. They have also launched phone helplines for information on the drug's availability. Until there is enough supply to meet the demand, however, many will keep looking to illegal suppliers. ""I understand the black marketing should stop, but at the same time the government should ensure enough stocks are available,"" said Dinesh in Mumbai, whose father is also still recovering in a hospital. © 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

The event, which was attended by more than 3000 people and could be heard five-miles away, was held on a disused airfield on Saturday evening (July 18). Avon and Somerset Police were not able to safely intervene to halt the illegal rave but called in additional officers to help break up the gathering on Sunday morning. Speaking about the incident, Chief Superintendent Ian Wylie said: “We’re sorry for the disruption caused to so many residents. It’s frustrating that we are having to pull officers away from our 999 response to deal with the selfish actions of the organisers of this event and those attending it. “They knew full well the disruption this would cause and the ongoing risk to public health of large gatherings due to Covid-19. We brought officers in from their rest days and called on support from neighbouring forces to close down this event.” Wylie added that police had managed to stop another rave earlier on Saturday in Frome, with officers suspecting that the event may have been organised by the same people. It is thought that the organisers had a number of possible sites for the illegal event in order to dupe the police. One arrest was made and sound equipment and vehicles were seized which police hoped would help them identify the organisers. They also launched an appeal asking people with any information to come forward. Back in June, experts warned that England could experience a wave of illegal raves over the summer as the coronavirus lockdown is eased. With the summer festival and live music season effectively wiped out by the coronavirus outbreak, it’s now feared that many young people will turn to these illegal mass gatherings throughout the summer. Speaking to The Guardian, Night Time Industries Association chief executive Mike Kill said “the youth of today want to be out and want to be engaged”. “There are a lot of people out there who are socially starved at the moment. And that’s why these illegal raves are starting to pop up because [people] have been trapped inside four walls for a long time now,” he said. “I don’t think there is anyone in our industry who couldn’t see this coming.” Kill added: “Without very clear timelines there’s a lot of people looking at creating their own opportunities, socially, and putting on raves – almost like the 80s, in some respects.” Thousands of people attended two raves in Greater Manchester in June, during which a 20-year-old man died from a suspected overdose, a woman was raped and three people were stabbed.

Steven L. Younce, 38, was charged with possessing methamphetamine to distribute, possessing firearms in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime and being a felon in possession of firearms. Deputies with the U.S. Marshals Service arrested Younce at his home Thursday. He had outstanding municipal warrants, according to the attorney’s office. On Thursday, the detectives from the Independence and Kansas City police departments, as well as U.S. Marshals deputies, executed a search warrant.

		Deputies Shutter Illegal East County Pot Dispensary	","Authorities raided and shuttered an illegal marijuana shop in eastern San Diego County Tuesday. Deputies and county code enforcement officers served a search warrant at the illicit dispensary in the 14300 block of Olde Highway 80 in the unincorporated community of Flinn Springs, near El Cajon, about 10:15 a.m., according to sheriff's officials. The personnel seized 292 pounds of marijuana, along with concentrated cannabis, edible products infused with the drug and about $4,700 in cash, sheriff's Sgt. Kelly Moody said. The business had been the subject of ""several complaints"" from the public, Moody said. In 2017, the Board of Supervisors banned marijuana businesses in all unincorporated areas in San Diego County, though two existing medicinal-cannabis dispensaries -- one near El Cajon and another in Ramona -- were granted waivers allowing them to operate for five more years before closing."

Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep vehicles as well as in CNH Industrial’s Iveco trucks have been found to contain potentially illegal engine management software to mask excessive pollution levels, Frankfurt prosecutors said. The Frankfurt prosecutor’s office stopped short of naming Alfa Romeo and Fiat’s parent company, Fiat Chrysler, since under German law only individuals, not companies, can be prosecuted. The investigation targets nine individuals working at an “internatioal carmaker” and seeks to establish their role in putting cars equipped with potentially illegal emissions software on public roads the prosecutor’s office said. A spokesman for FCA said that a number of the group’s offices in Europe were visited by investigators in the context of a request for assistance by magistrates in Germany, adding that it was cooperating fully with authorities. In a similar emailed statement, CNH Industrial confirmed that a number of its offices in Europe have been visited by investigators after a request by German magistrates and that it was cooperating fully with authorities. FCA and CNH Industrial are both controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy’s Agnelli family. Potentially illegal software has been detected in the 1.3 litre Multijet and 1.6 litre Multijet engines used in Alfa Romeo, Jeep and Fiat engines as well as in commercial diesel engines used in Iveco and Fiat commercial vehicles, the prosecutors said. Although these cars passed pollution tests in a laboratory, the cars used software to largely switch off exhaust emissions filtering while driving on the road, they added. The investigation, which is coordinated by EU justice agency EUROJUST, focuses on nine individuals living in Italy and their activities between 2014 to 2019, they said.

excessive force,https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/jul/22/family-excessive-force-negligence-metro-gomez-suit/,"In lawsuit, family claims excessive force, negligence by Metro in Jorge Gomez death","Jeanne Llera, mother of Jorge Gomez, responds to a question about her son’s death during a news conference at the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse in downtown Las Vegas Wednesday, July 22, 2020. Gomez was shot and killed by Metro Police officers in front of the courthouse during a George Floyd protest on June 1, 2020. Wednesday, July 22, 2020 | 8:45 p.m. Adequate training would’ve prevented a series of events that ended in the shooting death of a protester at the hands of Metro Police officers as a George Floyd-inspired protest ended last month, his family alleges in a federal lawsuit to be filed this week. Jorge Gomez’s family, a team of lawyers and community activists gathered Wednesday on the steps of the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse, near where officers gunned him down, to not only announce the legal action against Metro, but to share messages of “who he is and who he was not.” Allegations in the 21-page complaint include excessive use of force, negligence and wrongful death, accusing Metro of failing to train its officers and denying medical care to a wounded Gomez, 25, the night of his death, according to attorney Rodolfo Gonzalez. The four officers who opened fire are individually named in the lawsuit. Rivaling narratives emerged following the shooting in downtown Las Vegas, after police ordered the rowdy protest dispersed late on June 1. Gomez, who was open-carrying two guns, approached officers standing atop the federal courthouses steps, where he was ordered to leave before one of them hit him with bean bags, Metro said. Subsequently, as Gomez ran away, four officers who were driving by got out and opened fire when he pointed a long gun at them. Since the Metro officers weren’t regular patrol officers, they weren’t required to wear body cameras. Metro only provided a grainy, short video that shows an officer confront Gomez at the steps before he is seen running away. The officers who shot Gomez were on their way to the unrelated shooting of Officer Shay Mikalonis, who was shot in the head on the Strip while trying to break up another group of protesters, police said. Investigators found two loaded guns on Gomez and one concealed in his backpack. He was also wearing a tactical vest. Police said he didn’t fire any rounds. Gomez’s family and their legal team see the video in another light. Gomez was leaving the protest and was harassed as he was walking toward his car, they allege. His last message to his father, a K9 security officer, was moments before the shooting, and said, “Father, I’m on my way to go pick you up,” attorney Edgar Flores said. The elder Gomez, who was at work, had loaned his son the car that day and was waiting to be picked up. He never made it. A staunch supporter of the First and Second Amendments, Gomez was exercising his right to protest and open-carry, they said. Investigators only spoke to the family once shortly after the shooting, they said. Metro initially said Gomez was growing increasingly radicalized and that his family had expressed concern. His family contends that was not the case and that they were only concerned for his safety at the protest. They describe Gomez as an amiable and kind person who displayed his true nature when he hugged a woman at the same rally. She was protesting her son’s death by Metro officers. Carol Luke told the Sun that Gomez told her to keep telling her son’s story. On his Facebook page, Gomez published anti-Donald Trump messages and wrote about the police brutality protests. He posted a vague message of a revolution. Gomez’s family is also demanding that Metro release more footage, noting that at least a dozen cameras surround the area where their loved one was slain. They say their attempts to obtain further video or investigative documents from Metro and the other local police agencies have been futile. They have also tried contacting federal officials to see which agencies might’ve been at the protest, they said. “It appears that if you want to get some type of justice, some transparency, a lawsuit is the only thing that will get them to do that,” Flores, the attorney, said. Metro officer shootings require those involved go through two reviews that could take months. One looks at any possible criminal activity against the officers, and the other scrutinizes the policies, whether they were followed, or if they need to be amended. Metro spokesman Larry Hadfield said the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation and didn’t offer any updates on the investigation. “There has to be better training and accountability,” Flores said. “Law enforcement needs to know that they can hold themselves accountable and that it’s OK ... that is how you gain the trust of the community, when you hold each other accountable.” The lawsuit is “larger than us,” said Flores, noting that it wasn’t only about Gomez or even Floyd, but “every single person that’s lost their life and they didn’t get their time in front of the camera ... and nobody screamed (their) name on the street like we’re doing today.” Those present at the news conference Wednesday wore themed T-shirts demanding justice for Gomez and held black-and-white copies of a portrait showing him smiling. Posters showcased him at various stages of his life. Gomez loved avocados, so family members and lawyers wore green avocado-themed face coverings. Jeanne Llera took to the microphone to describe her son. She said Gomez, who was born in Orlando, Florida, knew Las Vegas from several years ago when the family relocated after his father got a job here when he was a child. After graduating high school in Orlando, he was itching to go back West. He eventually moved to Oregon and got two jobs as he waited to go back to school to be a veterinary pathologist. Gomez lost both jobs when the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. He moved to Las Vegas to be with his father. And then he saw the footage of a Minneapolis police officer digging his knee into George Floyd’s neck while Floyd pleaded that he couldn’t breathe, they said. The death sparked nationwide protests, even in the middle of a pandemic, and they occurred here, too. Gomez grabbed his guns and hit the streets in protest at least once before the night he was killed, police and family said. Llera said the family wants Metro to be transparent about why they shot her son, noting that she’s not asking them for a “miracle” in bringing him back to life. “I just wish,” she said, her voice trailing as she began to cry."
excessive force,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alabama-prisons-excessive-force-justice-department-report/,Justice Department says Alabama inmates are subjected to excessive force,"The Department of Justice has found that the conditions at Alabama's prisons for men violate inmates' constitutional rights because they are subjected to excessive force. After a multi-year investigation, the department discovered the use of excessive force by correctional officers at 12 of the 13 facilities evaluated, violating inmates' Eighth Amendment rights. ""Given the identified pervasiveness of the uses of excessive force and the statewide application of [Alabama Department of Corrections'] use of force policies and procedures, we have reasonable cause to believe that the uses of excessive force occurring within Alabama's prisons give rise to systemic unconstitutional conditions,"" the Justice Department wrote in a letter to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. The Eighth Amendment protects inmates from ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" and during their investigation, the Justice Department found instances where correctional officers used excessive force on inmates by using batons, chemical agents and physical force. Some inmates were victims of excessive force when they were already restrained or subdued, and there was no heightened risk to officers. ""The Constitution guarantees prisoners the right not to be subjected to excessive force and to be housed in reasonably safe conditions,"" Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. ""Our investigation found reasonable cause to believe that there is a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners in Alabama's prisons for men. The Justice Department hopes to work with Alabama to resolve the department's concerns."" The department opened an investigation into the prison system in October 2016 under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, into three areas of concern: whether inmates were protected from physical or sexual abuse from other inmates, from correctional officers, and whether inmates were living in sanitary, secure, and safe conditions. While the department did not find evidence to suggest that correctional officers were sexually assaulting inmates, they did find a pattern showing a ""lack of accountability in reviewing and tracking uses of force."" They also noted that many instances of excessive force likely went unreported. ""Ultimately, Alabama does not properly prevent and address unconstitutional uses of force in its prisons, fostering a culture where unlawful uses of force are common,"" the report said. The Justice Department said that 13 prisons for men in Alabama hold 16,600 men in-house — 6,000 more than they have the capacity for. DOJ pointed to issues of overcrowded facilities and understaffing as potential causes for the increased rate of excessive force. Last year, two inmates died after use of force incidents at two separate prisons in the state. In one case, officers reported that an inmate fell from a bunk bed, however, the autopsy showed that the prisoner died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head and that he suffered from ""intracranial bleeding, fractures of his nose and left eye socket, and had at least six teeth knocked out."" Two officers were placed on leave. ""Despite ADOC's awareness of these incidents, it failed to effectively address systemic deficiencies—particularly with respect to accountability measures—that are leading to uses of excessive force,"" the report alleges. ""We also found that ADOC failed to make and maintain proper records of excessive force incidents and that ADOC was unwilling to produce records that it did maintain."" This is the second time since last April that the department found unconstitutional conditions in the state's troubled prison system. At the time, the Justice Department said the state failed to protect inmates from ""prisoner-on-prisoner violence, prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse, and by failing to provide safe and sanitary conditions."" The DOJ warns that they will file a lawsuit if the state does not take action to rectify the situation in 49 days. © 2020 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Be in the know.

The U.S. Department of Justice wrote Gov. Kay Ivey, Department of Corrections leaders and prison wardens about the report, the second the state has received in 15 months. The Montgomery Advertiser, part of the USA TODAY Network, could not reach Ivey or ADOC leaders for comment. ""There is reasonable cause to believe that the correctional officers within the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) frequently use excessive force on prisoners housed throughout Alabama’s prisons for men,"" the Department of Justice wrote to Ivey. Among the 13 prisons under review by the Department of Justice, all but one were flagged for ""frequent uses of excessive force."" ""Given the identified pervasiveness of the uses of excessive force and the statewide application of ADOC’s use of force policies and procedures, we have reasonable cause to believe that the uses of excessive force occurring within Alabama’s prisons give rise to systemic unconstitutional conditions,"" the letter read. In its report, the DOJ said prison officials were aware of excessive force, including incidents in which prisoners were killed, but failed to address the issue. ""We also found that ADOC failed to make and maintain proper records of excessive force incidents and that ADOC was unwilling to produce records that it did maintain. ... Throughout the investigation, ADOC also prohibited us from interviewing non-supervisory correctional officers and severely restricted our access to individuals working in prison health care units,"" the report said. In an investigation in November, the Montgomery Advertiser found prison administrators flout the department’s rules and regulations in an attempt to exert control and discipline prisoners. The newspaper interviewed dozens of men incarcerated across the state. ""There are no meaningful checks and balances within the system, no substantial means of accountability on the part of certain correction officials; lower level as well as at the upper echelon levels,"" prisoner James Taylor said in a letter about conditions in 2019. ""[Lack of accountability] is blatant. Inmates see it, know it, recognize it, and have grown tired of it, and this is why many inmates are resistant to entertain attempts at true change [or] reform."""
excessive force,https://www.startribune.com/doj-alabama-inmates-are-subjected-to-excessive-force/571879582/,Federal review: Alabama inmates subjected to excessive force,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama prisons have a pattern of using excessive force against male inmates, the U.S. Department of Justice announced in an investigation released Thursday, as it again accused the state of keeping prisoners in unconstitutional conditions. In its report, the Justice Department detailed a chilling litany of incidents, including a prison guard beating a handcuffed prisoner in a medical unit while shouting, ""I am the reaper of death, now say my name!"" as the prisoner begged the officer to kill him. It is the second time within 18 months that the Justice Department has accused Alabama of housing male inmates in unconstitutional conditions in a prison system considered one of the most understaffed and violent in the country. ""Our investigation found reasonable cause to believe that there is a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners in Alabama's prisons for men,"" Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. Dreiband said the Justice Department hopes to work with Alabama to resolve the department's concerns. In findings sent to the state, federal investigators wrote that officers have beaten handcuffed or restrained prisoners, excessive force is sometimes used as retribution, the state prison system fails to investigate incidents and the violence is so common that some officers consider it normal. ""Ultimately, Alabama does not properly prevent and address unconstitutional uses of force in its prisons, fostering a culture where unlawful uses of force are common,"" the report read. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement that her administration remains hopeful that they will reach a resolution to all of the department's allegations. ""I am as committed as ever to improving prison safety through necessary infrastructure investment, increased correctional staffing, comprehensive mental-health care services, and effective rehabilitation programs, among other items,"" the Republican governor said. The report noted that at least two inmates died at the end of 2019 after use of force by officers. Steven Davis died in October 2019 after an altercation with corrections officers at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility. The department said at the time that Davis rushed the officers with a makeshift weapon. In an apparent reference to the incident, the report said other inmates said ""correctional officers continued to strike the prisoner after he dropped any weapons and posed no threat."" The report said an autopsy listed 16 distinct injuries to the prisoner's head and neck — including multiple skull fractures— in addition to multiple fractured ribs and bleeding around a kidney Davis' mother last year showed a state task force a photograph of her son's battered face. ""This is my son,"" Sandy Ray said as she held his photo. ""He is beaten beyond recognition. I had to have a closed casket because of what they had done to him. No one, not even a dog, deserves this."" The 28-page Justice Department report listed other examples of violence by staff after reviewing files and visiting several state prisons. The Justice Department said those included: — In December 2018, a correctional officer brutally punched, kicked and struck a handcuffed prisoner with an expandable baton in the Ventress medical unit. During the beating, four nurses heard the officer yell something to the effect of, ""I am the reaper of death, now say my name!"" and the prisoner begged to die. — In September 2019, a lieutenant at Ventress prison lifted a handcuffed inmate off the ground and slammed him on a concrete floor several times, knocking him unconscious. — In February 2019, a sergeant at Elmore prison beat two handcuffed prisoners, suspected of retrieving contraband, striking one prisoner with a collapsible baton approximately 19 times on his head, legs, arms, back and body. The sergeant who assaulted the prisoners later filed a false report about the incident. The sergeant and two correctional officers pleaded guilty in federal court. The announcement comes more than a year after the Justice Department released a scathing report that said male inmates face excessive inmate-on-inmate violence and sexual abuse in facilities that are not sanitary, safe or secure. The department is in negotiations with the state in an attempt to reach an agreement. The findings released Thursday were the continuation of the investigation first launched in 2016. ""What does it take to get fired?"" said Rep. Chris England, a Tuscaloosa lawmaker who has called for the new leadership at the state Department of Corrections. ""Our whole system of corrections and pardons and paroles has got to be the worst in the country."" Advocacy groups said the findings reflect concerns they have been expressing for years. Charlotte Morrison of the Equal Justice Initiative said they hear ""every week"" from inmates, parents and sometimes staff concerned about abuses. ""We've been asserting that the prisons need serious reform, and most of the time the state responds with cosmetic changes, but these problems are much deeper than that and that is what this report details,"" Morrison said. © 2020 StarTribune.

Please enable notifications or using normal browsing mode. An Oakdale man filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday against a Suffolk County police officer, alleging the cop used excessive force when he fired his Taser on him during an encounter that was captured on surveillance video. Craig Costello, 52, is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorney’s fees in connection with the encounter in a West Islip driveway on Jan. 3 at around 11 p.m.  It began with an apparent investigation into whether Costello was driving without a license, according to the lawsuit. The suit identifies the defendant as ""Police Officer Grenia, Badge Number 62224."" The Suffolk County Police Department declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. The Suffolk Police Benevolent Association, the union that represents officers, also did not respond to a request for comment. ""As caught on video, the officer approached the Plaintiff in the driveway of his brother’s home as the officer investigated the Plaintiff for unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle,"" the lawsuit says. ""The officer threw a kick, pointed what appeared to be a gun, and a conversation ensued between the officer and the Plaintiff from approximately five feet’s distance from each other.  With Plaintiff then having not exercised any physical force against the officer at all, the officer shot an electric current into the Plaintiff’s body, crumbling the Plaintiff onto the concrete where he began screaming and convulsing."" One of Costello's attorneys, Alexander Klein of Garden City, said in the lawsuit that the amount of force used against Costello was ""unreasonable"" given that Costello was not resisting arrest or under suspicion for a violent crime. ""We’re not saying he didn’t have a right to pull him over if there’s a vehicle and traffic violation, if he knew or suspected the car was being driven by someone without a license,"" said Bruce Barket, whose firm is representing Costello. ""We’re interested in it because of the excessive force that was used on Mr. Costello in his driveway ... And we find out later, it’s over a traffic ticket."" In an interview with Newsday, Costello said he was texting his girlfriend in the parking lot of a CVS Pharmacy about 11 p.m. just a few blocks from his brother's home, where he was housesitting. The officer drove up beside him, asked what he was doing, but then drove away, according to Costello, who said he then drove home.

Costello then fell to the ground and screamed in pain and was quickly handcuffed. ""What the [expletive] did I do?"" Costello yelled at the officer as he lay on the ground. ""Why would you tase me?""

excessive force,https://www.pressherald.com/2020/07/23/portland-woman-files-suit-against-city-police-alleging-illegal-arrest-excessive-force-in-2014/,"Portland woman sues city and police, alleging illegal arrest, excessive force in 2014","A Somali refugee says her civil and constitutional rights were violated in the incident at Maine Medical Center, as part of a pattern of over-policing of the city's refugee and African American populations. A Portland woman is suing the city, two police officers and the former police chief over a 2014 incident at Maine Medical Center, alleging that police violated her civil and constitutional rights when she was injured during an illegal arrest, and doctors at the hospital then tied her to a hospital bed, gagged her and medicated her without consent. The lawsuit Mumina Ali filed in U.S. District Court in Portland on Wednesday says city police officers became frustrated with Ali because of a language barrier, leading one of them to illegally arrest her as she attempted to find her teenage daughter, who was being cared for at the hospital following a separate interaction with police. Ali chipped a tooth and suffered other injuries following the violent and unnecessary arrest that continue to cause her pain today, the suit states. She seeks $750,000 in damages plus other costs and penalties. More broadly, Ali, who was a refugee from Somalia and became a U.S. citizen in 2010, says the incident fits a pattern of unconstitutional mistreatment of Somali refugees and Black residents by the city’s police department through systematic over-policing of Black and refugee-populated neighborhoods, leading to a higher proportion of arrests of Black people in the city than their white peers. The suit also alleges that although Ali filed a formal complaint about her treatment, the police never properly investigated it. The city has reopened the investigation, according to social media posts by Ali’s daughter, Hamdia Ahmed, a Portland activist who created an online fundraiser to pay the legal fees associated with investigating her mother’s case. In 2017, Black people accounted for 23 percent of arrests and 26 percent of reported uses of force by police, but made up only 7 percent of the population, the lawsuit alleges. The racial disparity has persisted for years, and mirrors national trends. “The numbers speak for themselves,” said attorney Thomas Hallett, who represents Ali in the lawsuit. “The Portland Police Department is plagued by the same issues that other police departments are plagued by.” The lawsuit was filed one day before the expiration of the six-year statute of limitations for such claims. The suit also names officers Jeffrey Druan and Suna Shaw, and former police chief Michael Sauschuck, who led the department until 2018. He is now Maine’s public safety commissioner. Hallett said the claims against the individual officers are distinct from the broader allegations against the city and the former police chief for creating a pattern of unconstitutional policing that disproportionately affects Somalis and other Black residents, a so-called Monel claim that requires a different legal analysis and may prove to be a higher bar to meet. Ahmed, who has led demonstrations against anti-immigrant policies, systemic racism and police brutality for years, posted on the fundraising page and on her Facebook page that the city agreed to reopen and reinvestigate the alleged excessive force case after Ahmed mounted a campaign asking residents and friends to call, write and email city officials demanding action. “It took six years to get my mother’s case reopened. Power to the people,” Ahmed wrote on Facebook on June 15, two days before she started the fundraising campaign. “Even though the case was reopened, I will not be celebrating. There is really nothing for me to celebrate about because no one should ever be put in a position like this. I watched my mother experience tremendous pain for the past six years. I never talked about it publicly or shared our story because I was angry about what happened to my own mother. No one should ever have to experience police brutality. Black people deserve to be treated like human beings.” Ahmed declined to comment and referred questions to Hallett, who declined to comment on the fundraising campaign or Ahmed’s fundraising. But the narrative provided on the fundraising website, entitled “Justice for Mumina A,” matches the date and the narrative of Ali’s claims described in the suit. A spokeswoman for the city, Jessica Grondin, confirmed the city was in receipt of the lawsuit but she declined to answer questions about the allegations, including whether the internal affairs case has been reopened by police, because of the pending lawsuit. According to the complaint, Ali moved to Maine in 2006 as a political refugee fleeing the civil war in Somalia, and spent eight years in a refugee camp in Kenya with her five children. Ali’s eldest daughter, referred in the complaint only by the initials “SA,” continued to suffer from severe post-traumatic stress disorder after the family’s arrival in the United Sates and Maine. When symptoms of SA’s mental health led to a crisis, the family called police on multiple occasions seeking help, the lawsuit alleges. The allegations of mistreatment center on a July 22, 2014, incident that began with the arrest of SA on unspecified charges. Ali, who at the time spoke and understood little English, relied on another daughter, then 16 years old and referred to only with the initials “HA,” to speak on behalf of the family because HA had the best English language skills. Hallet declined to say whether “HA” is Hamdia Ahmed. The suit alleges that HA called the Cumberland County Jail and “asked why her sister was once again being harassed by the PPD and that it was making HA think of harming herself,” the lawsuit  states. “Within a very short amount of time HA was handcuffed with hands behind her back and put in a police car by (East Bay Side Community Policing Center) police Officer Jeffrey Druan,” the suit said. When HA was placed in a police car, she vomited, which led Druan to transport HA to Maine Medical Center. Ali alleges that HA was never asked by Druan what she meant by the threats of self-harm, and that no social worker was present during the interaction. “Had HA been asked she would have explained that she never intended nor wanted to harm herself, that she had tried but could not get law enforcement’s attention in any other way, and as a 16-year-old trying to save her sister she made the statement as a last resort,” the lawsuit alleges. Ali, unaware of where HA was taken, walked to the Portland Police Station, the Cumberland County Jail and Mercy Hospital before finding her daughter at Maine Medical Center’s emergency department. At the hospital, Druan, Shaw and a Department of Health and Human Services social worker attempted to get Ali to sign a document, but she refused to sign it without an interpreter who spoke her dialect of Somali, fearing the document would lead to the loss of custody of her daughter, the lawsuit states. Ali alleges that when she refused to sign the document, officer Shaw became frustrated and told Druan to remove Ali from the hospital. The lawsuit alleges that Druan “aggressively handcuffed (Ali’s) hands behind her back.” Ali suffers from asthma and knee and back problems from previous injuries, and walks slowly. When Druan pushed her to walk faster than she could, her legs gave way beneath her and she fell, the suit states. “Without the use of her hands to break the fall (Ali) fell forward, chipped one of her teeth and screamed in pain, the suit alleges. Druan then “put both knees on her back, pushed her head into the ground, then began choking her from behind with his arm, and placed a hand over her mouth to muffle her screams as she lay prone on the ground,” the suit alleges. Ali was then taken back into the Maine Medical Center emergency department while still in handcuffs, placed facedown on a table in a five-point restraint system, and was “effectively ‘hogtied,'” the suit alleges. The suit states that Ali was yelling inside the hospital, and was then involuntarily injected with anti-psychotic medications Haldol and Ativan until she was released six hours later and left to walk home.

The report found that Alabama corrections officers frequently use excessive and sometimes deadly force in violation of inmates' constitutional rights in 12 out of 13 prisons the DOJ reviewed. Investigators found ""reasonable cause to believe that the uses of excessive force occurring within Alabama's prisons give rise to systemic unconstitutional conditions."" Corrections officers used batons, chemical spray and physical actions such as kicking and beating to discipline inmates, leading to serious injuries and at least two deaths last year. One of those incidents occurred in October 2019, where investigators found ""the level of force used caused the prisoner to sustain multiple fractures to his skull, including near his nose, both eye sockets, left ear, left cheekbone, and the base of his skull, many of which caused extensive bleeding in multiple parts of his brain."" ""The autopsy listed 16 separate and distinct injuries to the prisoner's head and neck, in addition to multiple fractured ribs and bleeding around a kidney,"" the report found. According to investigators, in one instance a corrections officer told an inmate, ""I am the reaper of death, now say my name!"" as the inmate was being beaten. The prisoner reportedly begged the officer to kill him. The pattern of abuse came to light after a series of civil rights lawsuits against the Alabama prison system over the years, including litigation filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). ""The violent conditions and circumstances outlined in the DOJ's latest report are at the hands of prison personnel and demonstrate failures of the Alabama Department of Corrections' leadership to ensure people in their custody are safe,"" Ebony Howard, the SPLC's senior supervising attorney, said in a statement. ""This unconstitutional behavior will not be solved by building newer, larger prisons."" The report gave Alabama officials 49 days to address the concerns detailed by the DOJ, warning the attorney general may sue. Alabama's Republican Attorney General Steve Marshall has said he is against the state entering into a legal agreement with the federal government over prison conditions. He said the state was ""ambushed"" by the report and that they have ""never denied the challenges that the Alabama Department of Corrections is facing."" ""Alabama will not be bullied into a perpetual consent decree to govern our prison system, nor will we be pressured to reach such an agreement with federal bureaucrats, conspicuously, fifty-three days before a presidential election,"" Marshall said in a statement."

(AP) — Alabama prisons have a pattern of using excessive force against male inmates, the U.S. Department of Justice announced in an investigation released Thursday, as it again accused the state of keeping prisoners in unconstitutional conditions. In its report, the Justice Department detailed a chilling litany of incidents, including a prison guard beating a handcuffed prisoner in a medical unit while shouting, “I am the reaper of death, now say my name!” as the prisoner begged the officer to kill him. It is the second time within 18 months that the Justice Department has accused Alabama of housing male inmates in unconstitutional conditions in a prison system considered one of the most understaffed and violent in the country. “Our investigation found reasonable cause to believe that there is a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners in Alabama’s prisons for men,"" Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. Dreiband said the Justice Department hopes to work with Alabama to resolve the department’s concerns. In findings sent to the state, federal investigators wrote that officers have beaten handcuffed or restrained prisoners, excessive force is sometimes used as retribution, the state prison system fails to investigate incidents and the violence is so common that some officers consider it normal. “Ultimately, Alabama does not properly prevent and address unconstitutional uses of force in its prisons, fostering a culture where unlawful uses of force are common,"" the report read. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement that her administration remains hopeful that they will reach a resolution to all of the department’s allegations. “I am as committed as ever to improving prison safety through necessary infrastructure investment, increased correctional staffing, comprehensive mental-health care services, and effective rehabilitation programs, among other items,” the Republican governor said. The report noted that at least two inmates died at the end of 2019 after use of force by officers. Steven Davis died in October 2019 after an altercation with corrections officers at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility. The department said at the time that Davis rushed the officers with a makeshift weapon. In an apparent reference to the incident, the report said other inmates said “correctional officers continued to strike the prisoner after he dropped any weapons and posed no threat."" The report said an autopsy listed 16 distinct injuries to the prisoner’s head and neck — including multiple skull fractures— in addition to multiple fractured ribs and bleeding around a kidney Davis' mother last year showed a state task force a photograph of her son's battered face. “This is my son,” Sandy Ray said as she held his photo. “He is beaten beyond recognition. I had to have a closed casket because of what they had done to him. No one, not even a dog, deserves this.” The 28-page Justice Department report listed other examples of violence by staff after reviewing files and visiting several state prisons. The Justice Department said those included: — In December 2018, a correctional officer brutally punched, kicked and struck a handcuffed prisoner with an expandable baton in the Ventress medical unit. During the beating, four nurses heard the officer yell something to the effect of, “I am the reaper of death, now say my name!” and the prisoner begged to die. — In September 2019, a lieutenant at Ventress prison lifted a handcuffed inmate off the ground and slammed him on a concrete floor several times, knocking him unconscious. — In February 2019, a sergeant at Elmore prison beat two handcuffed prisoners, suspected of retrieving contraband, striking one prisoner with a collapsible baton approximately 19 times on his head, legs, arms, back and body. The sergeant who assaulted the prisoners later filed a false report about the incident. The sergeant and two correctional officers pleaded guilty in federal court. The announcement comes more than a year after the Justice Department released a scathing report that said male inmates face excessive inmate-on-inmate violence and sexual abuse in facilities that are not sanitary, safe or secure. The department is in negotiations with the state in an attempt to reach an agreement. The findings released Thursday were the continuation of the investigation first launched in 2016. “What does it take to get fired?"" said Rep. Chris England, a Tuscaloosa lawmaker who has called for the new leadership at the state Department of Corrections. “Our whole system of corrections and pardons and paroles has got to be the worst in the country."" Advocacy groups said the findings reflect concerns they have been expressing for years. Charlotte Morrison of the Equal Justice Initiative said they hear “every week"" from inmates, parents and sometimes staff concerned about abuses. “We've been asserting that the prisons need serious reform, and most of the time the state responds with cosmetic changes, but these problems are much deeper than that and that is what this report details,"" Morrison said."

""This is my son,"" Ray said in December, showing the before-and-after photos of Steven Davis, 35. ""I had to have a closed casket because of what they had done to him,"" she said, according to The Associated Press. ""No one, not even a dog, deserves this."" The Alabama Department of Corrections said Davis' death in October came at the hands of two correctional officers at the Donaldson Correctional Facility outside Birmingham, where he had been serving a 20-year sentence for his role in a 2006 murder. To this day, Ray knows little more than what was publicly released: Her son, brandishing prison-made weapons in each hand, ""attempted to strike an officer,"" according to prison officials. When he refused to comply with their orders, the staff members ""applied physical measures to [defuse] the threat."" After the altercation was over, Davis was taken to the hospital and died the next day. Despite attempts to learn from officials what transpired and the push for a full criminal investigation into the correctional officers' actions, ""they act like it didn't happen,"" Ray told NBC News on Friday. Her lingering concerns, however, were acknowledged in a 28-page Department of Justice report released Thursday that investigated broad allegations of excessive force across men's prisons in Alabama. The review is notable for being yet the latest to sound an alarm over what inmate advocates and legal groups have long described as unconstitutional conditions within the state prison system. ""These uses of excessive force — which include the use of batons, chemical spray, and physical altercations such as kicking — often result in serious injuries and, sometimes, death,"" the Justice Department report found. ""Indeed, in the last months of 2019, at least two prisoners at two different ADOC facilities died following uses of force."" While the report doesn't directly name Davis as being one of the two deaths, it casts greater light on what happened to him. In his case, the Justice Department noted, ""numerous prisoner-witnesses ... reported that correctional officers continued to strike the prisoner after he dropped any weapons and posed no threat."" Ray said she's ""glad that the findings have been made public, and while it's a little too late for my son, it can be a warning for others."" The Justice Department investigation was opened in October 2016 to examine conditions at the state's 13 prisons for men, which house about 16,000 inmates, and a litany of complaints of physical and sexual harm and excessive force by correctional officers. As a result, an initial federal report in April 2019 found that the prisons are violating the Constitution by failing to protect inmates from violence and sexual abuse, and by keeping them in overcrowded facilities. Those findings prompted Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, to set up a study group on criminal justice policy, the work of which was supposed to be the cornerstone of this year's legislative session. Proposals to potentially reduce prisoner recidivism, reconsider long sentences for certain nonviolent offenders and increase the oversight of prisons were all under consideration, according to state Sen. Cam Ward, a Republican who chairs the State Senate Judiciary Committee. The coronavirus pandemic derailed the effort's momentum. The Southern Poverty Law Center found that in May, when the Alabama Board of Pardons andParolesreconvened after canceling hearings because of the pandemic, it granted parole for only 15 people out of 160 cases reviewed that month. All but four of those prisoners are white. The Justice Department's latest report focused on allegations of excessive force and concluded that prisoners' constitutional rights to be protected from ""cruel and unusual punishment"" were being violated. Among the cases cited include incidents like one in December 2018, in which a correctional officer beat a handcuffed prisoner while yelling out, ""I am the reaper of death, now say my name!"" according to witnesses. In another, in February 2019, a sergeant beat two handcuffed prisoners and then filed a false report; and in September 2019, a lieutenant slammed a prisoner on a concrete floor and knocked him unconscious. ""Our investigation found reasonable cause to believe that there is a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners in Alabama's prisons for men,"" Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. Louis Franklin, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Alabama, called the allegations ""distressing,"" and said the agency is ""hopeful that our continued work with State officials can ensure that the Department of Corrections abides by its constitutional obligations."" In a statement following the Justice Department's report, Ivey said she remains ""committed as ever to improving prison safety through necessary infrastructure investment, increased correctional staffing, comprehensive mental-health care services, and effective rehabilitation programs, among other items."" Alabama, which has one of the highest incarceration rates in the United States, is tackling criminal justice reform under the stress of prison overcrowding. The Justice Department said the state's prisons are cumulatively housing 6,000 prisoners above their designed capacity. But both the Alabama Department of Corrections and state Attorney General Steve Marshall were taken aback by the report. ""We were ambushed,"" Marshall said in a statement. He said that while the Department of Corrections is facing challenges, the state is responding with the construction of three new men's prison facilities to help ease the burden. Alabama, he added, ""will not be bullied into a perpetual consent decree to govern our prison system, nor will we be pressured to reach such an agreement with federal bureaucrats."" State corrections officials said Friday that the department is addressing the excessive force allegations through a newly formed violence reduction task force, refresher trainings for correctional staff, the implementation of so-called use-of-force review officers, and a pilot program for correctional officers to use body cameras, similar to police departments. Cynthia Roseberry, deputy director of policy at the American Civil Liberties Union's Justice Division, said Alabama and other states, like Mississippi andSouth Carolina, with similar problems of prisoner overcrowding, violence and lack of funding are floundering under a ""lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality."" She added that the Justice Department report only confirms that the problem is systemic. Meaningful reforms can't wait, she said, particularly with the deadly and rapid spread of the coronavirus in prisons. ""When someone dies, our government shouldn't require a human sacrifice before it takes action,"" Roseberry added. Ray said she understands that some people may not see prison reform as being essential while states, including Alabama, grapple with the ongoing public health crisis, but she believes the criminal justice system can engulf any family when they least expect it. ""Don't ever say, 'It won't be me,'"" she said. ""Because the first person screaming and hollering, saying, 'That person deserved to die anyway,' well, it might be your child, your grandchild or your brother next.""

excessive force,https://www.al.com/politics/2020/07/doj-reasonable-cause-that-excessive-force-in-alabama-prisons-violates-constitution.html,DOJ: ‘Reasonable cause’ that excessive force in Alabama prisons violates Constitution,"Evidence shows that Alabama state prisons do not protect male inmates from excessive use of force by correctional officers, likely violating the prisoners’ constitutional rights, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday. The DOJ’s findings, included in a report issued Thursday, come after the agency began investigating conditions in Alabama state prisons in 2016, and after DOJ put Alabama on notice last year when it found  the state “routinely” violating prisoners’ constitutional rights by failing to prevent inmate-on-inmate violence and sexual assault and that two prisoners died from excessive use of force by corrections officers. “After carefully reviewing the evidence, we conclude that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions in Alabama’s prisons violate the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution and that these violations are pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights protected by the Eighth Amendment. Specifically, we have reasonable cause to believe that the correctional officers within the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) frequently use excessive force on prisoners housed in Alabama’s prisons for men. Such violations are pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights secured by the Eighth Amendment,” the DOJ said Thursday in a letter to Gov. Kay Ivey. “We identified frequent uses of excessive force in 12 of the 13 Alabama prisons that we reviewed. Given the identified pervasiveness of the uses of excessive force and the statewide application of ADOC’s use of force policies and procedures, we have reasonable cause to believe that the uses of excessive force occurring within Alabama’s prisons give rise to systemic unconstitutional conditions. We also identified a lack of accountability in reviewing and tracking uses of force. We did not find a systemic pattern or practice of sexual abuse by staff.” While DOJ said it could initiate a lawsuit against the state to force changes in the prison system, it prefers to work with Ivey instead on making those changes. The governor said she is hopeful a resolution could be reached. “I am as committed as ever to improving prison safety through necessary infrastructure investment, increased correctional staffing, comprehensive mental-health care services, and effective rehabilitation programs, among other items,” she said in a statement. “We all desire an effective, Alabama solution to this Alabama problem, and my administration will put in the hard work and long hours necessary to achieve that result.” The department found that excessive use of force by correctional officers is “too common” in Alabama’s men’s prisons. “All too often, correctional officers use force in the absence of a physical threat while making no effort to de-escalate tense situations. Such uses of force heighten tensions in already violent and overcrowded prisons. Failing to de-escalate these situations properly endangers the safety of prisoners and staff,” the agency’s report stated. “Correctional officers also use force as a form of retribution and for the sole purpose of inflicting pain. Such uses of force violate the Eighth Amendment.” In two cases last year, inmates died from excessive use of force, DOJ said. A prisoner at Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer was beaten in November after he complied with demands to drop a prison-made weapon and died at a hospital, and another at Ventress Correctional Facility in Barbour County died in December after multiple blunt force trauma injuries at the hands of correctional officers. Among other egregious examples cited by DOJ include a lieutenant at Ventress lifting a handcuffed prisoner off the ground and slamming him into the concrete floor several times, rendering him unconscious in a September 2019 incident. The prisoner wasn’t able to breathe on his own and he had to be intubated at an outside hospital, where CPR was used to keep him alive. Officers also inappropriately used chemical spray, the agency said. “Prisoners who do not present a danger are frequently sprayed with chemical agents. In those cases, officers seem to punish prisoners for not complying with a verbal order,” the report said. “Chemical spray is regularly used as retribution.” The DOJ also cited several instances where correctional officers used force as punishment or retribution against prisoners and the officers were not disciplined. “The Constitution guarantees prisoners the right not to be subjected to excessive force and to be housed in reasonably safe conditions,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “Our investigation found reasonable cause to believe that there is a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners in Alabama’s prisons for men. The Justice Department hopes to work with Alabama to resolve the department’s concerns.” Louis Franklin, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Alabama, who along with Alabama’s other two U.S. attorneys participated in the investigation, called the findings “distressing. We are hopeful that our continued work with State officials can ensure that the Department of Corrections abides by its constitutional obligations,” Franklin said. “While we recognized the challenges of correcting systemic constitutional deficiencies in Alabama prisons that have existed for decades, now is the time for significant reform. The three U.S. Attorneys in Alabama are committed to a just resolution of this matter,” said Richard Moore, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama.

false arrest,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/ruling-camden-man-can-seek-damages-for-wrongful-arrest/ar-BB175uL1,Ruling: Camden man can seek damages for wrongful arrest,"CAMDEN – A city man was wrongly arrested during an intensive hunt for a gunman and can ask a jury to award damages, a state appeals court has ruled. Robert Bryant, a street vendor, was charged with obstruction when he allegedly refused to identify himself to a Camden County Police officer investigating a September 2013 school bus shooting. But Bryant was not required to answer the officer’s questions, Tuesday’s ruling said. The decision, which overturned several rulings by a lower court judge, found the officer, Jose Gonzalez, was liable for Bryant’s false arrest. It also said a new trial could be held to determine any damages owed to Bryant. Justin Loughry, a Camden attorney for Bryant, praised the ruling and said it showed “lines that shouldn’t be crossed” by police. But a Camden County spokesman asserted the arrest was proper. “We will be asking the Supreme Court to hear this case,” spokesman Dan Keashen said Wednesday. He said Gonzalez ""did not make an arbitrary decision to investigate the arrested man, but was following up on a heinous shooting investigation."" Bryant was arrested six days after a bus carrying more than 20 preschoolers was hit by gunfire on a Centerville street. One child suffered minor injuries from a shard of metal or glass, authorities said. Police were looking for a suspect vehicle believed to be a red Ford Taurus or a Mercury Sable, when Gonzalez saw Bryant sitting in a parked car meeting that description. The car, a Taurus, was at a shopping center about 10 to 12 blocks from the shooting scene. According to the ruling, Bryant denied any involvement in the shooting and was described by Gonzalez as “very uncooperative.” In a police report, Gonzalez said he told the vendor “that if he refused to answer any of my questions, he would be placed under arrest for obstruction."" “He again refused and was subsequently placed under arrest,"" the report said. The obstruction charge was later downgraded, then dismissed, according to the ruling. The car sought by police was later determined to be a Mercury Sable, it said, and three men were charged in connection with the shooting. According to the appeals court, a trial judge erred in September 2018 when he rejected Bryant’s motion for a directed verdict in his favor. Instead, Superior Court Judge Anthony Pugliese allowed the case to go to the jury, which found no cause of action against Gonzalez. The appellate ruling said Pugliese found the jury could “draw inferences” that Bryant had been operating the parked car. That would ""lead this into the realm of a motor vehicle stop"" and allow Gonzalez to demand Bryant's identification. But the three-judge panel said Gonzalez did not approach Bryant for a suspected motor-vehicle violation. As a result, it said, Bryant ""had the right to refuse to turn over his identification."" It says the encounter turned into a ""constitutionally permissible"" investigatory stop when Gonzalez suspected Bryant might have a gun in his waistband. But after a frisk found no weapon, the ruling says, Bryant ""was under no obligation to turn over his identification or answer any of Gonzalez's questions,"" the ruling said. ""Bryant committed no unlawful act to impede the shooting investigation,"" it added. ""To rule otherwise gives law enforcement without a reasonable basis the right to demand that a person answer questions or provide identification and charge that person under the obstruction statute for not complying,"" the ruling said. The appeals court said Pugliese correctly rejected Bryant’s claim that he faced retaliation from two Camden County police officers after filing his lawsuit.

Sign up for our newsletter and go inside the world of music, culture and entertainment. Federal officers arrest a protester after a rally at Portland, Oregon's Justice Center on July 17, 2020 against racism, police brutality, and the uninvited actions of dozens of Federal officers. The state of Oregon is suing the Trump administration in federal court to halt what it likens to the “kidnap and false arrest” of protesters in downtown Portland, alleging that the administration’s secret-police tactics are violating core constitutional rights. In a harrowing new tactic, reminiscent of fascist regimes, armed federal officers without agency badges have begun grabbing protesters off the street, throwing them into unmarked cars and jailing them without formally arresting them, according to court records. The state of Oregon is seeking a permanent injunction to prevent what it alleges are violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against “unreasonable seizures” and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantees of due process. Demonstrators in Portland have been protesting police brutality for seven weeks since the killing of George Floyd. The city’s cops have cracked down on these protests with even more brutality, turning a small area of downtown into a nightly battle space. Typically, minor provocations by individual agitators — throwing water bottles, removing fencing, or defacing buildings — have been met with overwhelming and indiscriminate police violence against the crowds, including the use of tear gas, pepper spray, flashbang grenades, less-lethal munitions, and baton beatings. The Portland Police Bureau, whose officers have been allowed to cover the names on their badges, have beaten and arrested journalists attempting to document these clashes, charging some with felonies. Over the course of the protests, the PPB has been subject to two temporary federal restraining orders to protect the First Amendment rights of reporters and legal observers, and to constrain the indiscriminate use of tear gas during a pandemic. This illiberal spectacle has emboldened the worst impulses of our authoritarian president. On orders from Trump to control “the anarchists and agitators” and quell “50 days of anarchy,” federal agents descended on Portland. As the feds have stepped in, the epicenter of the nightly protests has shifted from the Multnomah County Justice Center — a local booking, jail, and courthouse complex — to the neighboring federal courthouse, which has been tagged with graffiti like: “Send home Trump’s piglets” and “FEDS get the FUCK OUT!” Picking up where the PPB has been constrained, federal agents have subjected demonstrators to chemical agents and physical violence. One nonviolent protester who tossed away a tear gas canister at his feet was shot in the head with an impact munition, hospitalizing him with a fractured skull. Oregon officials, from Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler to Gov. Kate Brown to Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley have called on the feds to withdraw from the city. Federal officials have insisted they’re not about to leave: “That’s just not going to happen on my watch,” tweeted acting Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf. There is no clear indication of who is perpetrating these snatch-and-hold detainments — the patches on their fatigues simple read “police.” But the lawsuit names four federal agencies believed to be involved in the Trump administration’s Portland response: The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Protective Service, and the U.S. Marshals. It’s routine for federal agents to guard federal property, but the allegedly unlawful snatch-and-detain operations have gone well outside that purview. The lawsuit, brought by Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, insists that the federal tactics make it impossible for detained citizens to know whether they are being lawfully arrested or are instead the victims of a crime. “Ordinarily, a person exercising his right to walk through the streets of Portland who is confronted by anonymous men in military-type fatigues and ordered into an unmarked van can reasonably assume that he is being kidnapped,” the lawsuit states. Oregon is a state with active militias, many affiliated with white supremacy movements and hostile to the racial-justice aims of the protesters. The lawsuit highlights the inability of citizens to know whether they have a right to fight back. It argues that the feds are “taking away citizens’ ability to determine whether they are being kidnapped by… malfeasants dressed in paramilitary gear (such that they may engage in self-defense to the fullest extent permitted by law) or are being arrested (such that resisting might amount to a crime).” The lawsuit also also argues that the Trump administration’s tactics have a chilling effect on First Amendment rights to speech: “Citizens who are reasonably afraid of being picked up and shoved into unmarked vans — possibly by federal officers, possibly by individuals opposed to the protests — will feel compelled to stay away, for their own personal safety, and will therefore be unable to express themselves in the way that they have the right to do.” In addition to defending the rights of its citizens, the Oregon suit also accuses the feds of usurping state and local authority “without serving any legitimate federal law enforcement purpose.” The state of Oregon, it insists, has “sovereign interests in enforcing its laws and in protecting people within its borders from kidnap and false arrest.” Sen. Wyden praised the lawsuit as an urgent and necessary corrective, before the administration’s authoritarian tactics take hold elsewhere in the country: “If Donald Trump’s unconstitutional abuses can happen in Portland, they can happen anywhere,” he wrote. “This lawsuit is necessary to shed light on the truth and hold Trump accountable for his authoritarian tactics on American soil.” President Trump, for his part, praised the actions of federal agents in Portland, saying “they’ve done a fantastic job… they grab em; lotta people in jail.” The president said he’s responding to “anarchists,” insisting: “These aren’t protesters. These are people who hate our country.” Trump is now threatening to expand the deployment of federal agents to other cities. “We’re sending law enforcement,” he told reporters. “Because we’re not going to let New York and Chicago and Philadelphia and Detroit and Baltimore and all of these — Oakland is a mess. We’re not going to let this happen in our country. All run by liberal Democrats.” Trump appears to be using his crackdown on dissent as a campaign strategy, claiming that Democrats are too  “weak” and “scared” to stand up to demonstrators, and that if Joe Biden were to win the election in November, “the whole country would go to hell.” Want more Rolling Stone?

Police officers drove her to the hospital. The narrative that is being reported about Sunday’s morning events are inaccurate and I’d like to set the record straight. On Sunday morning, I suffered gunshot wounds, as a result of a crime that was committed against me and done with the intention to physically harm me. I was never arrested, the police officers drove me to the hospital where I underwent surgery to remove the bullets. I’m incredibly grateful to be alive and that I’m expected to make a full recovery, but it was important for me to clarify the details about this traumatic night. I’m currently focused on my recovery, so I can return back to my life and back to making music as soon as possible. She added in her caption, ""I was never arrested.

Megan's statement comes after TMZ claimed Megan was put in handcuffs and detained by police, seemingly speculating based off a grainy video it ran on the site. Tory Lanez had been arrested with a gun charge. TMZ claimed that Megan ""was ultimately taken to the hospital for a cut on her foot."" The reality, as Megan explained in her Instagram, is much more serious. Filming mine as we speak. Wait, no, sorry, ""TWIN FLAMES."" The actress said she knew something ""wild"" would happen to her after learning that the rapper was her costar. Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker, made headlines back in May when the two Midnight In The Switchgrass co-stars were seen driving around Calabasas. Since then, the couple has been seen around Los Angeles together, fueling dating rumors — but the pair’s relationship evolved into something more fiery than just a fling. Fox calls them twin flames.“I knew right away that he was what I call a twin flame,” Fox said during the couple’s first joint interview on Lala Kent and Randall Emmett’s podcast, Give Them Lala … With Randall. “Instead of a soulmate, a twin flame is actually where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time. So we’re actually two halves of the same soul, I think. And I said that to him almost immediately, because I felt it right away.”According to astrologer Lisa Stardust, Fox’s explanation of the phenomenon is pretty accurate. A twin flame, she says, is when two people emerge from one. “A twin flame is a very interesting concept,” she tells Refinery29. “The way that twin flames work is that you have to be awakened and conscious to the other person being your twin flame.” Both people must be aware that they are twin flames in order for the pairing to work. From their interview, it seems like Fox and Kelly are both totally awake to their twin flame status.“I think it was the second day [of filming],” Fox said. “I asked him to come into my trailer for lunch, and I put him through all of this astrology stuff. I went deep right away. I knew before I even did his chart, I said to him, he has a Pisces moon. I could tell by his energy.” She added that she asked Kelly “900,000 questions.” Being someone’s twin flame is not dissimilar from being their soulmate, but it’s much more intense — and while many people believe you can have multiple soulmates throughout your life, you can only have one twin flame. It’s not always a romantic connection, though — a twin flame can manifest into an intense friendship.In astrology, Stardust says we can see twin flame energy by comparing the nodal aspects on our birth charts. “Basically, you kind of feel like you knew each other in a past life and the relationship will take on an intense energy,” she says. “The love has to be really honest and unconditional otherwise a part of you will be driven to reject your twin flame.”According to Stardust, twin flames can have the same thoughts or emotions at the same time, share many of the same interests, intuitively know what the other person is feeling or thinking, have a very strong physical pull, understand the hidden parts of each other, and feel like it’s safe to be around this person. Like we said: intense.During our interview Stardust pulled up both Fox and Kelly’s birth charts — and even she admits that the two are meant to be. “They have a past life connection,” she explains. “When we look at past lives in astrology, we look at the nodes, and when a planet aligns with the south node, it means that there is a twin flame connection. Her moon is on his south node, and his moon is on her north node, which means they were in each other’s lives before.”If you’re searching for your own twin flame, Stardust advises that you have to first be open and ready for it. It’s a lot of energy — but if it results in a partnership as fated as Fox and Kelly’s, it sounds like it’s worth it.Like what you see?

false arrest,https://bradblog.com/?p=13501,,"Philadelphia's progressive District Attorney Larry Krasner told Democracy Now's Amy Goodman on Thursday that any federal officers who break state law within the City of Brotherly Love will be arrested and prosecuted. His comments come in response to President Trump's threat to expand the ""totalitarian"" assaults by his secret police from Portland, Oregon to other cities run by ""liberal Democrats."" The argument may be legally supportable, but the issue entails not only the question of whether local DAs and police have the authority to effectuate the arrest of miscreant federal agents but also of weighing the risk of potentially adverse consequences... Krasner acknowledges that federal agents are welcome, when invited, to lawfully engage in specific joint law enforcement activities.  Indeed, he said, his office or a local law enforcement agency will often step aside for the feds in the interests of efficiency.  But it's an altogether different issue when local leaders and agencies oppose federal intervention. Former U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal, during a Wednesday appearance on MSNBC's The Last Word, cited a 2000 Supreme Court decision authored by former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a Nixon appointee.  ""Our constitution,"" Katyal observed, ""doesn't generally permit a domestic federal police force.""  At a minimum, in Katyal's legal analysis, sending federal agents to our cities to conduct local law enforcement against the express opposition of state and city authorities requires Congressional approval.  Trump neither sought nor obtained Congressional authority in this instance. Katyal's analysis is echoed within the 22-page decision handed down on Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge Michael H. Simon.  In that case, the court issued a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent federal police from assaulting and arresting the journalists and legal observers who are lawfully covering protests in Portland, Oregon. In response to the federal government's argument that ""journalists have no to right to stay, observe and document when the government 'closes' public streets,"" Judge Simon replied that federal agencies ""are not the agencies that 'close' state public streets and parks; that is a local police function."" Katyal, who referred to the federal agents operating in Portland as ""thugs"", described Trump's federal police operation as a ""rebellion against our deepest constitutional principles."" Measuring risk v. reward While technically legal, an attempt by local law enforcement authorities to effectuate an arrest of armed federal agents could be fraught with risk. In a federal lawsuit, Oregon's Attorney General Ellen Rosenbaum argued that when armed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, without probable cause, snatched an innocent citizen, Mark Pettibone, off a Portland sidewalk and whisked him away in an unmarked car, those agents interfered with Oregon's ""sovereign right"" to protect ""people within its own borders from kidnap and false arrest."" If Krasner is legally correct about the right of local authorities to arrest federal agents who break state laws, Oregon and Portland would have been operating within their legal jurisdiction if they had deployed a SWAT team to surround the CBP agents, secured Pettibone's release and arrested the CBP agents. But these are armed federal agents.  What happens if they resist? Would an armed shootout between state and federal agents become the opening salvo in a new civil war?  Would Trump exploit that event as an excuse to further accelerate his assault on democracy? It's a difficult call, especially given Katyal's description of what is occurring in Portland right now as ""a rebellion against our deepest constitutional principles.""  At a minimum, however, Krasner and other local law enforcement should carefully consider the potential for a disastrous outcome, or at least lay out strict rules of engagement, before attempting to arrest federal agents. Perhaps, the wiser course was the one applied by Oregon's AG.  Challenge the illegality of Trump's totalitarian assault in a federal court.   State and local authorities can then seek the identities of the miscreant agents during discovery in federal court proceedings, and subsequently go before a state grand jury to request indictments.

Moscow police officers arrested Ivan Golunov on June 6, 2019, on suspicion of drug dealing. He maintained his innocence and said the drugs were planted on him. After five days of public campaigning and protests, the case was closed and Golunov was released from house arrest. In January 2020, the now-former police officers who arrested Golunov were themselves arrested and charged with abuse of power, falsifying evidence, and drug possession. “I am now writing letters to the Attorney General’s Office exposing violations and requesting the reopening of the criminal proceedings against Golonov, which, in my opinion, were unlawfully and unduly terminated,” Lyakhovets told the Moscow City Court, during a July 22 appeal hearing on extending his arrest. Lyakhovets said that in his opinion, “there weren’t enough investigative actions to reasonably allow for such a decision to be made.” On July 15, Ivan Golunov filed a lawsuit against the five police officers who arrested him in the summer of 2019 and planted drugs on him in an attempt to frame him for felony offenses. Golunov is seeking 5 million rubles ($70,500) in damages. The lawsuit will be considered within the trial against the former officers."

		Lawsuit filed after false arrest for “school threats” in 2019	","WTAJ - www.wearecentralpa.com (WTAJ) — Numerous police departments, school officials, and former Blair County District Attorney Richard Consiglio have all been named in a lawsuit after the false imprisonment of Scott Vinosky, who was accused of making the phone calls to 5 different Hollidaysburg Area schools giving them a deadline to “reallocate resources” back in November 2019. Vinosky, who maintained his innocence, has stated in his complaint that officers made the arrest after failing to properly investigate the incident. The complaint states that a Logan Township officer already had former student, Javier Alberto Cantos, 24, in custody “minutes” after the messages were left and reportedly admitted to police that he made the calls on November 20, 2019. Vinosky states that he was wrongfully accused of the messages left at the school being his voice by two different Counselors that he was previously interning with, as well as a principal in the school district. Vinosky says he terminated from his internship at the school after filing a report with ChildLine after something a student told him, however, the school counselor stated he was being released because he was in contact with students while the counselor was not on school premises. They then reportedly gave false information to police on why the internship was terminated. On November 21, 2019, various technical experts were able to trace the phone calls back to a phone number that didn’t belong to Vinosky. The complaint reads that on November 21, 2019, at roughly 1:30 p.m. Vinosky was arrested in his home, then in State College, and brought to PSP Hollidaysburg and claims they searched his residence without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. He was interrogated, saying that police used “numerous tactics” to try and get him to admit he made the calls. Vinosky said he was then taken for a polygraph and was told he failed before being told to either admit to making the calls or face numerous felony charges. The Pennsylvania State Police, in conjunction with Allegheny Township andHollidaysburg Borough Police Department is currently investigating phonemessages left for all five schools in the Hollidaysburg Area School District. Themessages were concerning enough to the police to seek charges against thesubject who has been identified and is in police custody. No threat exists at thistime, and evening events will continue as scheduled. Further information willbe released as directed by the police. The complaint states that Vinosky had shown police he was on the phone with his girlfriend during the time the calls were placed to the schools.  Vinosky says he was then placed in a holding cell where he overheard police saying he was “weird” and speculating that he was autistic. Vinosky was then taken to Blair County Prison at approximately 10 p.m. on November 21, 2019, on numerous charges including Terroristic Threats, Harassment, Causing or Risking Catastrophe, and Disorderly Conduct. He also says he was the subject of persistent harassment by corrections officers at the prison. On November 22, 2019, just before 9 a.m., Vinosky was arraigned via video conference and then strip-searched and his mugshot was taken. Later that day, he was released from Blair County Prison on bail, and at roughly 3:21 p.m. police released a media advisory that Vinosky had been charged in connection with the phone calls, at which time numerous news outlets reported on it. This email is an update to the information sent yesterday afternoon regardingthe phone messages received at all five district schools. The PennsylvaniaState Police, in conjunction with the Hollidaysburg Borough Police Department,has announced an arrest. Scott Vinosky, a former guidance intern, has beencharged with placing the calls. Mr. Vinosky’s internship was ended last weekdue to performance. The messages were of a concerning nature but did notthreaten any individual nor detail any specific action. Finally, on November 24, 2019, Vinosky received a call from law enforcement and met them at the State Police Barracks in Ebensburg. Police told him that all charges would be dropped as they found that Cantos was the one responsible for the calls. They apologized to Vinosky for their errors. A jury trial has been demanded in this process as Vinosky is asking for judgment and damages in his favor that exceed the limits of compulsory arbitration, including punitive damages, attorney’s fees and costs of suit, and such other relief as the court may deem proper.

false arrest,https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882683463/the-computer-got-it-wrong-how-facial-recognition-led-to-a-false-arrest-in-michig,'The Computer Got It Wrong': How Facial Recognition Led To False Arrest Of Black Man,"Updated 9:05 p.m. ET Wednesday Police in Detroit were trying to figure out who stole five watches from a Shinola retail store. Authorities say the thief took off with an estimated $3,800 worth of merchandise. Investigators pulled a security video that had recorded the incident. Detectives zoomed in on the grainy footage and ran the person who appeared to be the suspect through facial recognition software. A hit came back: Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, 42, of Farmington Hills, Mich., about 25 miles northwest of Detroit. In January, police pulled up to Williams' home and arrested him while he stood on his front lawn in front of his wife and two daughters, ages 2 and 5, who cried as they watched their father being placed in the patrol car. His wife, Melissa Williams, wanted to know where police were taking her husband. "" 'Google it,' "" she recalls an officer telling her. Robert Williams was led to an interrogation room, and police put three photos in front of him: Two photos taken from the surveillance camera in the store and a photo of Williams' state-issued driver's license. ""When I look at the picture of the guy, I just see a big Black guy. I don't see a resemblance. I don't think he looks like me at all,"" Williams said in an interview with NPR. ""[The detective] flips the third page over and says, 'So I guess the computer got it wrong, too.' And I said, 'Well, that's me,' pointing at a picture of my previous driver's license,"" Williams said of the interrogation with detectives. "" 'But that guy's not me,' "" he said, referring to the other photographs. ""I picked it up and held it to my face and told him, 'I hope you don't think all Black people look alike,' "" Williams said. Williams was detained for 30 hours and then released on bail until a court hearing on the case, his lawyers say. At the hearing, a Wayne County prosecutor announced that the charges against Williams were being dropped due to insufficient evidence. Civil rights experts say Williams is the first documented example in the U.S. of someone being wrongfully arrested based on a false hit produced by facial recognition technology. What makes Williams' case extraordinary is that police admitted that facial recognition technology, conducted by Michigan State Police in a crime lab at the request of the Detroit Police Department, prompted the arrest, according to charging documents reviewed by NPR. The pursuit of Williams as a possible suspect came despite repeated claims by him and his lawyers that the match generated by artificial intelligence was faulty. The alleged suspect in the security camera image was wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals hat. Williams, a Detroit native, said he would under no circumstances be wearing that hat. ""They never even asked him any questions before arresting him. They never asked him if he had an alibi. They never asked if he had a red Cardinals hat. They never asked him where he was that day,"" said lawyer Phil Mayor with the ACLU of Michigan. On Wednesday, the ACLU of Michigan filed a complaint against the Detroit Police Department asking that police stop using the software in investigations. In a statement to NPR, the Detroit Police Department said after the Williams case, the department enacted new rules. Now, only still photos, not security footage, can be used for facial recognition. And it is now used only in the case of violent crimes. ""Facial recognition software is an investigative tool that is used to generate leads only. Additional investigative work, corroborating evidence and probable cause are required before an arrest can be made,"" Detroit Police Department Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood said in a statement. In Williams' case, police had asked the store security guard, who had not witnessed the robbery, to pick the suspect out of a photo lineup based on the footage, and the security guard selected Williams. Victoria Burton-Harris, Williams' lawyer, said in an interview that she is skeptical that investigators used the facial recognition software as only one of several possible leads. ""When that technology picked my client's face out, from there, it framed and informed everything that officers did subsequently,"" Burton-Harris said. Academic and government studies have demonstrated that facial recognition systems misidentify people of color more often than white people. One of the leading studies on bias in face recognition was conducted by Joy Buolamwini, an MIT researcher and founder of  the Algorithmic Justice League. ""This egregious mismatch shows just one of the dangers of facial recognition technology which has already been shown in study after study to fail people of color, people with dark skin more than white counterparts generally speaking,"" Buolamwini said. ""The threats to civil liberties posed by mass surveillance are too high a price,"" she said. ""You cannot erase the experience of 30 hours detained, the memories of children seeing their father arrested, or the stigma of being labeled criminal."" Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, said the case was dismissed over insufficient evidence, including that the charges were filed without the support of any live witnesses. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said any case sent to her office that uses facial recognition technology cannot move forward without other supporting evidence. ""This case should not have been issued based on the DPD investigation, and for that we apologize,"" Worthy said in a statement to NPR. ""Thankfully, it was dismissed on our office's own motion. This does not in any way make up for the hours that Mr. Williams spent in jail."" Worthy said Williams is able to have the case expunged from his record. Williams: ""Let's say that this case wasn't retail fraud. What if it's rape or murder?"" According to Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology, at least a quarter of the nation's law enforcement agencies have access to face recognition tools. ""Most of the time, people who are arrested using face recognition are not told face recognition was used to arrest them,"" said Jameson Spivack, a researcher at the center. While Amazon, Microsoft and IBM have announced a halt to sales of face recognition technology to law enforcement, Spivack said that will have little effect, since most major facial recognition software contracts with police are with smaller, more specialized companies, like South Carolina-based DataWorks Plus, which is the company that supplied the Detroit Police Department with its face-scanning software. The company did not respond to an interview request. DataWorks Plus has supplied the technology to government agencies in Santa Barbara, Calif., Chicago and Philadelphia. Facial recognition technology is used by consumers every day to unlock their smartphones or to tag friends on social media. Some airports use the technology to scan passengers before they board flights. Its deployment by governments, though, has drawn concern from privacy advocates and experts who study the machine learning tool and have highlighted its flaws. ""Some departments of motor vehicles will use facial recognition to detect license fraud, identity theft, but the most common use is law enforcement, whether it's state, local or federal law enforcement,"" Spivack said. The government use of facial recognition technology has been banned in half a dozen cities. In Michigan, Williams said he hopes his case is a wake-up call to lawmakers. ""Let's say that this case wasn't retail fraud. What if it's rape or murder? Would I have gotten out of jail on a personal bond, or would I have ever come home?"" Williams said. Williams and his wife, Melissa, worry about the long-term effects the arrest will have on their two young daughters. ""Seeing their dad get arrested, that was their first interaction with the police. So it's definitely going to shape how they perceive law enforcement,"" Melissa Williams said. In his complaint, Williams and his lawyers say if the police department won't ban the technology outright, then at least his photo should be removed from the database, so this doesn't happen again."

Florida is one of only two states — along with Oregon — generally considered to prohibit no-knock warrants, with which a judge gives police written authorization in advance to enter a property without issuing a warning or announcing themselves. But the same 1994 opinion by the state Supreme Court that found no-knock warrants were “without legal effect in Florida” also carved out circumstances under which police can decide to enter a property without warning or a judge’s approval, such as if there’s reason to believe announcing themselves would risk a suspect escaping or destroying evidence. Activist demands to eliminate unannounced raids — which trace back to the Nixon Administration — have ramped up since Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black emergency room technician, was killed by Louisville officers executing a no-knock warrant at her apartment in March. Provisions that allow officers to enter without knocking have been widely applied in recent decades, especially in drug cases, said Roy Bedard, a former law enforcement officer and expert witness on police tactics. But no-knock raids can create perilous and chaotic situations, he said. “What’s wrong with it is that it is a surprise, forcible entry into somebody’s house,” he said. “It’s very hard to sort out the chaos that occurs when somebody comes barging through your door, particularly when you don’t know who that person is because they haven’t announced themselves.” Florida law says police can force their way inside a home to execute a warrant only if “after due notice of the officer’s authority and purpose he or she is refused admittance” — language more commonly referred to as the state’s “knock-and-announce” rule. OPD’s proposed changes to its search warrant policy would set it apart from most major law enforcement agencies in Central Florida, which still either train officers on court-established exceptions to that rule or have written them into agency policy. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Michelle Guido said Orange County deputies are allowed to enter without warning under certain circumstances, such as if they arrive to hear gunshots and screams from inside a home. The Seminole County Sheriff’s Office policy on search and seizure says “a search warrant authorizing a no-knock entrance is no longer valid,” but gives four exceptions: when those inside already know deputies’ authority and purpose; when someone is in “immediate peril”; when danger to deputies would “increase if they were to announce themselves and their purpose” or when announcing their presence “would lead to an escape by any person within or the immediate destruction of evidence.” Sanford police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said agency policy allows for no-knock entries to be performed by Seminole County’s SWAT team. In Lake County, sheriff’s spokesman Lt. John Herrell provided a copy of a criminal law manual provided to deputies that lays out the same four exceptions that appear in Seminole’s policy. “Our practice, however, is to knock on the door as a recorded announcement is made over a loud speaker,” he said. The exceptions are absent from the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office’s search policy, which, similar to the proposed Orlando police policy, says deputies “shall knock, announce their purpose, and identify themselves as law enforcement officers before entering [a] structure.” Samantha Scarp, spokeswoman for the Kissimmee Police Department, said no-knock warrants “are not a tactic we use.” The agency’s search warrant policy doesn’t address the knock-and-announce rule or its exceptions. Bedard, the expert witness on police tactics, said there are circumstances when police must enter without announcing, such as during a hostage or human trafficking situation with imminent danger, which is why he believes it unwise to completely ban no-knock entries. Strong policies are needed to help officers prioritize safety over evidence, and violent crimes over lower-level offenses, he said. “We have to value human lives over seizures, and I think that’s where the law is headed now in the court of public opinion,” he said. The Florida Supreme Court’s ban on no-knock warrants stemmed from a 1989 raid at a home in Brandon. Hillsborough County SWAT deputies, who suspected resident Earl R. Bamber of dealing drugs, exploded a stun grenade as a distraction before charging in without warning. Deputies argued the unannounced intrusion was justified because an informant had said Bamber kept his drugs “near the bathroom,” where they could easily be flushed down the toilet or drain. Bamber’s wife and child — and two repairmen, who were tackled at gunpoint — were inside the home when deputies raided it. They found only small amounts of cocaine and marijuana. The state’s high court rejected the notion of advanced approval for no-knock raids, writing that, to enter a property without announcing themselves, officers had to have a reason based on “particular circumstances existing at the time.” In a presentation to the Orlando City Council this month, OPD Chief Orlando Rolón said the agency’s officers had “seldom” used no-knock warrants, which would be “banned” in all instances going forward. “If an agency comes into the Orlando Police Department jurisdiction and requests the assistance of an officer from OPD during a no-knock warrant, our officers are prohibited from participating in that also, that’s how serious we believe this policy change is,” he said. A draft of the revised policy shows that it was changed not to ban no-knock warrants — which the Bamber case did decades ago — but to eliminate court-permitted exceptions to the announcement requirement. Said OPD’s old policy: “There are times when entry to the structure may be made as an exception to the knock-and-announce requirement.” Those included if those inside the structure already knew the police were there and had time to let them in; if people inside were “in peril of bodily harm”; or if officers had “reasonable grounds to believe the occupants of the premises will attempt to destroy the contraband/evidence prior to its seizure.” The new policy, which is not yet finalized, says simply that OPD officers “must always knock and announce” themselves, listing no exceptions. Orlando defense attorneys Roger Weeden and Richard Hornsby both said they thought the new policy will likely have little effect on how officers conduct search warrants. Weeden noted that state law says an officer should provide “due notice” of their arrival and purpose when serving a search warrant but doesn’t require that the occupant give a response. It also doesn’t specify how long after that announcement officers can break in. OPD’s proposed policy says SWAT officers can use force to enter a building “[a]fter waiting a reasonable period of time” post-announcement. The courts have found a “reasonable period” can be shorter than 20 seconds, the defense lawyers said. And the exceptions to the knock-and-announce requirement OPD deleted from its policies still apply in court. “Will this have any practical effect on the way the… Orlando Police Department conducts their warrants? The answer is ‘no,’” Hornsby said. “… What they’re really bound by is the case law.” Autumn Jones, an OPD spokeswoman, said in an email the revised policy would “prohibit or prevent OPD officers from requesting or participating in ‘no knock’ warrants, even if exigent circumstances exist.” Bedard called OPD’s revised policy “sound,” noting it explicitly bars officers from helping another agency — such as out-of-state or federal-level law enforcement — execute no-knock searches. But he argued it lacks proper protocols for raids involving the mentally ill. “Policies are now being scrutinized for not having a provision… that if you know somebody is suffering from mental illness, all of the things that forcible entries involve exacerbate mental illness,” he said.

""I want to continue to shed light on justice for Breonna Taylor and to her family and everything that's going on with that situation,"" James said after the Lakers' played in a scrimmage against the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday.

Harris said that would be his answer for every question. His availability lasted less than one minute. James also called for arrests in the case. ""As one of the leaders of this league, I want her family to know, and I want the state of Kentucky to know that we feel for her and we want justice,"" James went on to say. ""What's right is right, and what's wrong is wrong."" Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was killed when police broke down the door to her apartment in an attempted drug sting and shot her eight times, in Louisville, Kentucky.

None of the officers involved in the shooting has been charged with a crime."

		A key miscalculation by officers contributed to the tragic death of Breonna Taylor	","(CNN) — In the early morning hours of March 13, police in Louisville, Kentucky, arrested a suspected crack cocaine dealer by the name of Jamarcus Glover. Glover was no kingpin. His arrest would not have made national headlines. But having him in handcuffs represented a key moment in a monthslong narcotics probe. Had it ended there it would have been a good night for the police. But in a related, near-simultaneous operation across town, officers wearing tactical vests set up outside an apartment on Louisville’s South End with a green door bearing a gold No. 4. It was the home of a young woman detectives suspected was tied to Glover’s alleged ring. Her name: Breonna Taylor. Officers used a battering ram to break down Taylor’s door, triggering a chain of events that would leave the unarmed 26-year-old woman fatally shot in a barrage of seemingly out-of-control police gunfire. Unlike the recent controversial killings of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks, there is no police body camera video of what transpired in the moments after officers bashed through Taylor’s door. And in an era of widespread demand for greater police accountability, it’s a case in which achieving a widely agreed upon sense of justice could prove elusive. In the absence of videotape evidence, the circumstances surrounding Taylor’s slaying have been widely discussed — and sometimes distorted — on social media and by pundits. Among the false claims is that police were conducting a raid at the wrong address, and that an officer injured in the shooting was a victim of “friendly fire” by fellow cops. Misconceptions aside, the police operation that night was tragically flawed. A CNN review of the incident found that a key miscalculation by police who assumed Taylor was home alone when she was in fact accompanied by a boyfriend who was legally armed, coupled with the decision to press forward with a high-risk, forced entry under questionable circumstances, contributed to the deadly outcome. This story is based on a review of search warrant affidavits, audio recordings of the official statements of key participants, 911 recordings and interviews with more than a dozen people. The chaotic scene that night was exacerbated by an officer accused by his own department of “blindly” firing 10 rounds into Taylor’s apartment from an outdoor patio. He’s since been fired and is appealing his termination. Police officials and prosecutors declined comment for this report, citing an ongoing investigation. Attempts to reach Glover, who faces drug trafficking charges stemming from the incident, were unsuccessful. His attorney said his client intends to plead not guilty but declined further comment. Walter Katz, a veteran police oversight expert who has monitored departments in Los Angeles, San Jose and Chicago, called the known circumstances surrounding Taylor’s death “very problematic,” and indicative of systemic flaws in training and tactics. The investigation, which now includes the state attorney general’s office and the FBI, is being closely watched not just in Kentucky, but across the US. Around noon on March 12, a Louisville police detective presented Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Mary Shaw with a stack of five search warrant applications for her approval, according to court records. They were for locations linked to Glover, a convicted felon suspected of supplying a local drug house. One of the places to be searched was Taylor’s apartment. Police said Glover used Taylor’s residence as his “current home address” as of a February 20 check of various online computer databases and had been receiving mail there, a three-page affidavit for a search warrant written by Detective Joshua C. Jaynes states. The detective said he saw Glover “walk directly” into Taylor’s apartment in mid-January and leave a short time later with a package. He then drove straight to a “known drug house,” Jaynes stated. Taylor’s car, the detective noted, had been seen parked outside another alleged drug house linked to Glover “on different occasions.” The affidavit did not document any activity regarding Taylor or her residence in March. Besides seeking approval for the searches, police wanted the judge to give them permission to execute the warrants without having to knock on the door, meaning officers could force entry if they saw fit. Such extreme tactics are supposed to be reserved for cases in which police fear suspects may try to arm themselves or are considered likely to destroy evidence if given the opportunity in the moments before a raid. Serving so-called “no-knock” warrants is considered among the most dangerous work in law enforcement. Police are supposed to precisely articulate for judges why such actions are needed in a given case. For each of his five warrants, Jaynes used identical language seeking to justify the no-knock entry: “These drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence, have cameras on the location that compromise Detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made, and have a history of fleeing from law enforcement.” The judge approved all the searches and gave the police permission to force entry into the locations if needed. In a written statement provided to CNN, Judge Shaw declined to discuss the details of the warrant, saying she was “restrained in my ability to comment on ongoing legal matters.” But, she said, she took more than 30 minutes to review and consider the warrant applications and “made the probable cause determination required of me by law.” Shaw added that Taylor’s death was a tragedy that “will stay with me forever.” Lawyers for Taylor’s family would later attack Jaynes’ affidavit for Taylor’s residence as weak and misleading. For example, any mail Glover may have received at her apartment would have been innocuous items such as clothes or shoes, one of the attorneys told CNN. “It definitely wasn’t drugs.” Hours after Shaw signed the warrants, police began the operation, conducting near-simultaneous raids at the various locations. Taylor’s apartment, according to police, was considered a less volatile, “soft target.” As such, police commanders decided in advance to have officers knock and announce their presence before entry. That decision was communicated in a pre-operational briefing, according to a source familiar with the details of the operation who requested anonymity due to the ongoing investigation. Sometime after 12:30 a.m., Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly began pounding on the door. He later told investigators he believed Taylor was alone and he wanted to give her sufficient time to answer. As officers waited for a response, a neighbor poked his head out to ask what was going on. One of the officers, Brett Hankison, extended his gun and told the neighbor to get back inside his apartment, Mattingly would later tell investigators. “Brett was a little bit worked up,” Mattingly said. “I remember looking at Brett, saying, ‘Brett, relax. Brett, just relax. Relax.” When there was no answer after repeated knocks, Mattingly said, he announced he was a police officer there to serve a search warrant. “Police. Come to the door,” he said. Another officer on the search team said he heard movement inside and thought someone was about to answer the door. “We kept banging and announcing,” Mattingly said, but still no one answered. Eventually, a lieutenant at the scene gave the order to “go ahead and hit” the door with the battering ram, Mattingly said. Taylor had been watching a movie in bed together with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker when she drifted off to sleep beside him. Walker told investigators he heard banging at the door after midnight and his first thought was that it was Glover. He said he knew Taylor had dated the accused drug dealer during their on-and-off seven-year relationship. He was concerned there might be trouble. Walker said there was no response. He said he and Taylor scrambled to get dressed and that he grabbed his gun, which his attorney said he legally owns. The pounding at the door continued, he said. “She’s yelling at the top of her lungs — and I am too at this point — who is it?” he recalled. “No answer. No response. No anything.” As they made their way down a hallway toward the front door, Walker said, the door flew off its hinges. “So I just let off one shot,” he said. “I still can’t see who it is or anything.” Mattingly was first through the door. He could make out a man and a woman in the darkened hallway, he said, and the man had a gun in his hand. “I remember seeing the barrel,” Mattingly said. Then, in an instant, he saw the flash of the muzzle and felt the heat of a bullet in his leg. The round had severed his femoral artery. Mattingly returned fire, squeezing off multiple shots in rapid succession. “Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom,” he recalled. In all, he said he fired six times. He remembered falling to the ground and being helped to safety outside the apartment before hearing fellow officers return fire. Hankison and Officer Myles Cosgrove were later identified as the other officers who discharged their weapons that evening. An attorney for Cosgrove declined comment. Hankison’s attorney did not respond to calls and emails from CNN. Mattingly’s attorney, Todd McMurtry, defended his client’s conduct. “Sgt. Mattingly was following orders of superior officers, was not involved in the planning process of the arrest, and at all times followed established police procedures,” he said. None of the officers has been charged with a crime. Inside the apartment, Walker was unharmed. But Taylor lay on the ground beside him, bleeding profusely. There were bullet holes everywhere, including in a neighboring apartment where a young child lived. Walker punched 911 into his cell phone. His voice sounds distraught as he tells the dispatcher someone had kicked in the door and shot his girlfriend. As the operator peppered him with questions, Walker repeatedly moaned his girlfriend’s nickname — “Bre” — and the word “help.” In the minutes after the shooting, Louisville police swarmed the parking lot of Taylor’s apartment complex. Officers with guns drawn shout commands from behind squad cars, as Walker walks backwards out of the complex with his hands in the air. He was taken away in handcuffs. Six days later, a grand jury indicted him of attempted murder of a police officer. The indictment was returned following a brief presentation in which members of the panel were essentially told only that Walker had opened fire on the police during a raid and that one of the officers had been hit. Grand jurors were not told that Walker said he was unaware the people who broke through Taylor’s door were police and that he believed he was acting in self-defense. Nor was the panel told of Taylor’s death. In May, Walker’s defense attorney, Rob Eggert, filed a motion to have the indictment dismissed. He said the prosecution’s presentation to the panel “completely mischaracterizes” what took place on the night Taylor was killed and that the grand jury was “woefully misled.” “Their way out of this was to bury my guy,” Eggert told CNN in a recent interview. “And that’s not right.” A day later, in a surprise move, the Louisville area’s top local prosecutor agreed to have the indictment against Walker dismissed. Thomas Wine, the Commonwealth’s Attorney for Jefferson County, said he disagreed that grand jurors had been misled, but agreed that it was important for them to hear from Walker directly before deciding whether to indict. If, after further investigation, the case was brought back to the grand jury, Wine said, Walker would be given that opportunity. Taylor’s shooting was well covered by the Louisville Courier Journal in the days and weeks after it occurred. But the case received comparatively little national exposure. That changed following the May 25 police slaying of Floyd in Minneapolis, Minneapolis, that sparked weeks of protests in cities around the country. Taylor’s case exploded into the national consciousness alongside Floyd’s. Last month, the Louisville city council passed Breonna’s Law, which banned no-knock warrants and requires officers serving search warrants to wear body cameras. Eight days later, Louisville’s newly appointed police chief gave Hankison a termination letter. The chief accused Hankison of blindly firing 10 rounds into Taylor’s apartment through a covered patio door and window that prevented him from assessing any threat posed by the occupants before opening fire. Some of his rounds penetrated a neighboring apartment and endangered the lives of three of its occupants, the letter stated. “I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,” the chief wrote. “Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department … and demands your termination.” The department’s Public Integrity Unit has completed a formal investigation into the shooting, but the results of the probe have not been publicly released. Meanwhile, FBI agents have taken documents from Louisville police investigators, according to a source familiar with the matter. At Taylor’s apartment complex, agents have been interviewing her former neighbors, one resident told CNN. Katz, the police oversight expert, said he believes there has been mounting pressure on prosecutors across the country to stop giving undue deference to the police version of events in controversial uses of force. But a case like Taylor’s, which has no video, demands a methodical, painstaking investigation that could take significant time to complete, he said. One key area of dispute in the case is whether police announced their presence before breaking down the door. Mattingly told investigators he and others did so repeatedly. Walker said he never heard anyone say “police” and that his and Taylor’s shouts of “who is it?” were met with silence. CNN interviewed several of Taylor’s neighbors, either directly or through their attorney. Most said they were awakened by the gunfire and therefore did not hear what preceded it. In a recent interview in a park overlooking downtown Louisville, Taylor’s sister and aunt spoke about the circumstances surrounding her slaying, and what they hope will come of her death. Her aunt, Bianca Austin, described Taylor as a “spunky, goofy little kid” who blossomed into a hard-working, goal-oriented young woman who placed an emphasis on family. At the time of her death, she had been working as a certified emergency medical technician. “She just was a fun person to be around,” Austin said. “She’s going to be truly, definitely be missed.” The loss has been so devastating on Taylor’s mother that she spent this past Mother’s Day in her room, refusing to get out of bed. Taylor’s sister, Ju’Niyah Palmer, who was also her roommate and best friend, acknowledged that Taylor had a past relationship with Glover. But she said her sister wasn’t involved in Glover’s alleged drug operation and had forbade him from bringing that aspect of his life into her personal life. “You cannot come up in my house with any drugs,” she quoted her sister as telling Glover. “My sister live(s) here and I can’t jeopardize her getting hurt because of what you do.” She said Taylor had nothing to hide in her apartment and would have been happy to prove that to the police if she’d known it was them at the door. “If they were to come in and say, ‘Hey, you sell drugs’, she’d be like … that’s not who I am,” Palmer said. Both women faulted the police for Taylor’s killing and said the officers involved should be charged with murder. “We’re going to fight this to the end,” her aunt said. “This is our baby and she’s going to get the justice she deserves.” The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) Breonna Taylor has become a national rallying point for opposition to no-knock warrants since she was killed by Louisville police who broke into her home in the middle of the night in a fruitless search for narcotics. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) There are times when police need the element of surprise — to be able not just to show up unannounced but also to break down a door and come charging into a house in the middle of the night, weapons drawn, in order to prevent a dangerous criminal from harming a hostage, or escaping, or destroying crucial evidence. That’s why the U.S. Supreme Court allows exceptions to what it calls “the common law knock-and-announce principle” in emergencies and when police anticipate such a situation and get a warrant allowing them to barge into someone’s home or business unannounced. But the practice is inherently dangerous — for bystanders, innocent targets and police — as the nation was reminded this spring when Louisville, Ky., police shot and killed Breonna Taylor after they raided her home in the middle of the night on a fruitless search for narcotics. Beyond the innocent victims, we’ve seen too many cases of the super-innocent, victims whose lives have been disrupted or even ended after police knocked down the wrong door. Clearly, there should be strict limits on when these so-called “no-knock” search warrants can be issued. But as S.C. Chief Justice Don Beatty discovered, those strict rules don’t exist in South Carolina. Our state has no written policy for when a judge may authorize a police raid. Worse, we allow our least-educated, least-trained, most political judges to issue no-knock warrants. Worse still, Justice Beatty explained, a “recent survey of magistrates revealed that most do not understand the gravity of no-knock warrants and do not discern the heightened requirements for issuing a no-knock warrant.” Even worse than that, he wrote: “It further appears that no-knock search warrants are routinely issued upon request without further inquiry.” So, the chief justice did the only thing a responsible official could do when he realized that such a dangerous tool was being handed out so promiscuously: He issued a moratorium on no-knock warrants until he can write some criteria. An excellent place to start would be limiting which judges can approve them. Justice Beatty probably could eliminate a lot of the problem if he barred magistrates from issuing no-knock warrants. As The Post and Courier’s Joseph Cranney reported last year, S.C. magistrates are hand-picked by local senators, frequently ignore defendants’ basic constitutional rights, don’t have to be attorneys and, in fact, have less required training than the state’s barbers or masseuses. At the least, restricting the authority to magistrates who have law degrees would ensure that the people who authorize police raids are familiar with the constitutional principles that need to be considered. We have no idea how many warrants are issued in South Carolina; the Charleston County Sheriff’s Office and the Charleston Police Department said they rarely use them, but PBS NewsHour reported last month that a 2010 study estimated police in the United States used 60,000 to 70,000 no-knock warrants annually. Despite those numbers, there’s no reason to think a temporary moratorium will put innocent lives in danger. Just the opposite. Absent any law to the contrary — and there is no law to the contrary in South Carolina — the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that police can barge in unannounced without a judge’s permission if they have “a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or ... would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence.” The main thing the warrant does is shield police from civil liability for the destruction they cause when they break down the right doors — and the added disruption they cause when they break down the wrong doors. That is, these warrants give the court’s stamp of approval for police raids. Frankly, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for our Legislature to consider banning no-knock warrants altogether, and perhaps even putting some limits of its own on what sort of evidence is important enough to allow any kind of police raids. In the meantime, though, it’s reassuring to know that our courts won’t be sanctioning any more police raids until Justice Beatty has a chance to put some rules in place.

(AP) — Louisville police officers who fatally shot Breonna Taylor while serving a warrant were told she should be home alone because the main target of the narcotics investigation was elsewhere, according to an interview with one of the detectives who served the warrant. Taylor was shot eight times after officers used a battering ram to knock down her door and fired into the apartment after midnight March 13. One officer was shot by Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who said he thought an intruder was breaking into the home. The slaying set off weeks of protests, policy changes and a call for the officers who shot Taylor to be criminally charged. Global protests on behalf of Taylor, George Floyd in Minnesota and others have been part of national reckoning over racism and police brutality. Sgt. Johnathan Mattingly, who was shot in the leg by Walker, spoke to Louisville Police internal investigators about two weeks after the raid. NBC News obtained the interview with Mattingly and another with Walker and released them Thursday. Several key parts of the interviews were played for the public in May when an attempted murder charge against Walker was dropped. Mattingly said ahead of the raid officers were told Taylor's ground floor apartment was a “soft target” and Taylor “should be there alone, because they knew where their target was and I guess they thought that he was her only boyfriend or only acquaintance.” Police were conducting a wide-ranging drug investigation that night. That target was an alleged drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested on trafficking charges the same night 10 miles (16 kilometers) away on a separate warrant. Taylor had a previous relationship with Glover. Earlier this week, lawyers for Taylor’s mother filed an amended civil lawsuit that alleged police initially called off the warrant search at Taylor’s apartment but then went ahead with it to attempt to locate other drug suspects that had no connection to Taylor. Glover had already been apprehended, the lawsuit said. Mattingly told investigators in the interview recording that officers briefed on the raid were told Glover had packages sent to her apartment in her name. Taylor “possibly held dope for him, received the packages and held his money,” Mattingly said he was told of Taylor's involvement. No drugs were found at Taylor's home. Police had secured a “no-knock” warrant for Taylor's apartment, but both Walker and Mattingly confirmed that police knocked on Taylor's door. The warrants have since been banned by a Louisville ordinance named for Taylor. State legislators on Thursday were also discussing a bill for a statewide ban of the controversial warrants. The bill would be introduced in January. Mattingly told investigators officers knocked for about 45 seconds to a minute before using the ram. He entered the home after the door was breached and saw two people, one with a gun, he said. It was Walker, who moments earlier was lying in bed with Taylor and watching a movie, Walker told investigators in a 90-minute interview. “I'm trying to protect her, she didn't have a gun,” Walker said of Taylor. Walker said he fired one shot toward the ground just as the door was being bashed in. That bullet hit Mattingly in the left thigh. Mattingly then fired about six shots, he said, and then scooted himself out of the apartment. Mattingly and another Louisville officer, Myles Cosgrove, were placed on administrative leave after the shooting. Another officer who was at the scene, Brett Hankison, has been fired for violating use of force procedures, for “blindly” firing 10 shots into the home, according to police. Mattingly said Hankison “was a little worked up” that night, and pointed his gun at a neighbor who was yelling at the officers. Walker spoke to investigators just hours after Taylor was shot, and without an attorney present, according to the interview. Walker said on his way to the interview, riding in a police car, the car stopped for another person who told Walker there was a “misunderstanding.” Walker said the man, driving a silver SUV, told him: “I just wanted to let you know right now ... we had a misunderstanding."" “It seems like to me they realized they were at the wrong place,” Walker said. Attorneys for Taylor's family have argued that police had no cause to go search her house. Mattingly said the bullet hit his femoral artery, and he was undergoing physical therapy. He spoke to investigators for about 40 minutes with his attorney in the room. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

wrong door raid,https://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/122132836/burglar-raids-pharmacy-twice-in-one-morning-after-stealing-wrong-medication,Burglar raids pharmacy twice in one morning after stealing wrong medication,"A Nelson man burgled a pharmacy twice within three hours after taking the wrong medication the first time. Russell James Edwards, 55, appeared in the Nelson District Court on Monday for sentence on two charges of burglary. At about 3am on the morning of April 28, Edwards went to the Collingwood St Pharmacy. Using a blunt instrument he hit the lower half of the door 15 times, creating a hole which he crawled through. He loaded a range of different medications into a satchel before leaving. However, just under three hours later Edwards returned to the pharmacy. Wearing different clothes but with the same satchel, Edwards removed the cardboard which had been put up as a temporary seal for the door, and headed back to the counter. He took several different containers, each with about a month’s worth of medication. Edwards later called the police to confess. He said he had been in pain and desperate and had returned to the pharmacy because he had picked up the wrong medication the first time. Lawyer Steven Zindel said Edwards had been in severe pain and had taken things he didn’t even need. Speaking via AVL link from Christchurch Prison, Edwards said he had felt guilty about what he had done, especially given he had “been out of trouble for so long”. “I was not in the best mental state but that’s no excuse, especially at my age.” Judge Jo Rielly said it was a shame Edwards was back in court for this type of offending. Judge Rielly said while Edwards had appeared before the court a number of times, his offending had abated in recent years outside of a few nuisance charges. She said she had to impose a prison sentence for Edwards, given the seriousness of the offence, but intended to keep the length of the sentence low as possible. She said while in custody Edwards had been cooperative, and had been motivated to change and accept help. Judge Rielly sentenced Edwards to 9 months imprisonment, with an option for home detention if a suitable residence could be found. She also imposed special release conditions for Edwards to attend a drug and alcohol programme, and a $2000 reparation fine."

            LAWSUIT: LMPD SWAT team raids vacant home, handcuffs wrong couple days after suspect already arrested
        
    ","Mainly dry aside from a isolated storm in southern KY. Hot, a bit humid. LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- With weapons drawn, Louisville Metro Police SWAT officers raided a home last July to serve a warrant on an alleged drug suspect, but instead, they handcuffed a man hired to paint the vacant house, his girlfriend and her 10-year-old daughter, a lawsuit claims. In fact, the suit alleges, LMPD officers had already searched the home in the 100 block of Amherst Avenue near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport 10 days earlier and arrested the person they were looking for -- and who was still in custody at the time of the July 15, 2019, raid. Roy Stucker had been hired as an independent contractor to work on the house for a new tenant when at least 10 officers raided the home in the Southside neighborhood “in military fashion,” shooting objects through windows and breaking in with weapons drawn, the lawsuit claims. The house had been empty for days, with furniture outside on the curb and Stucker’s painting truck sitting in front, according to the suit. Stucker and his girlfriend, Courtney Brown-Porter, initially believed they were being robbed and feared they would be killed, the suit claims. The couple and Brown-Porter’s daughter were allegedly handcuffed for about 20 minutes. The suit, filed in Jefferson Circuit Court on Tuesday against the city and police, argues LMPD could have easily verified that the target of the investigation had already been arrested and was in custody. Nathaniel Boyington was arrested at the home on drug trafficking charges on July 5, 2019, according to court records. The couple's attorney, Josh Rose, claims the city has refused to provide the search warrant affidavit used by police to conduct the raid. “This is yet another example of search warrants being issued and served without justification and in a dangerous manner,"" Rose said in an email. ""This is a systemic issue at LMPD that goes deeper than simply banning no-knock warrants or disciplining officers. The policies need to be overhauled and LMPD demilitarized.” The city and police department are already under intense scrutiny and criticism for the warrant served in March at the home of Breonna Taylor, who was shot five times by police and killed. No drugs were found at Taylor's home. Rose said there is body cam video of the incident in the recent lawsuit, but what he received from police was heavily redacted, and he is trying to get an unaltered version. An LMPD spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The department does not typically comment on pending litigation. The suit claims the family was unlawfully imprisoned and is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages. Rose has a similar pending lawsuit against police and the city he filed last year on behalf of a Louisville couple who say they were getting their three kids ready for school when 14 Louisville Metro Police SWAT officers raided their home, smashing through the front door, using explosive devices and holding the family at gunpoint. The reason for that raid: A detective claimed he smelled marijuana coming from outside the West Chestnut Street home on separate occasions and believed someone was growing and selling marijuana inside, according to a search warrant. That lawsuit claims there was no probable cause for a raid, that the search warrant included false information, and police misconduct created a situation that “very easily could have resulted in the death of a parent or child for no good reason.” In fact, a man and woman named in the search warrant affidavit and described as growing and selling marijuana did not live at the home, information that could have easily been discovered by police, according to the suit. The couple who owns the home, Ashlea Burr and Mario Daugherty - a local artist whose work has been featured at the Kentucky Derby Museum and on local news - were not growing or selling marijuana, the suit says. WDRB News could not find any charges from the raid in court records. This story may be updated. Copyright 2020 WDRB Media. All Rights Reserved.

wrong door raid,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2020/07/14/leaving-warcraft-shadowlands-covenants-will-be-easy-coming-back-is-hard-to-do/,Leaving ‘Warcraft: Shadowlands’ Covenants Will Be Easy; Coming Back Is Hard To Do,"Pledging allegiance to the Venthyr in World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. One of the key features of this fall’s World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion will require players to commit to the faction, or covenant, they choose in the popular MMORPG. That choice will affect everything from your character’s power to how they look and the abilities they use. Covenants include cosmetic options, such as fancy capes and armor, that are only available to characters that ally with them. They include basic covenant abilities, including travel and combat enhancements. And they include “Soulbinds,” individual non-player characters that players can link their fates with, providing them with three different mini-talent trees of new abilities (one for each NPC) that can be enhanced with relic-like Conduits for additional power. Swapping between Soulbinds, or swapping between abilities in those talent trees, requires a click of a button at your covenant’s HQ. Replacing Conduits, for now, requires destroying the old one to replace it with a new one, gathered as part of dungeon, raid, outdoor world and other content. But just because Blizzard Entertainment wants your covenant choice to feel meaningful in Shadowlands doesn’t mean you’re permanently stuck with that commitment. I chatted with Warcraft Game Director Ion Hazzikostas about exactly what it will take to swap from one covenant to another (hint: not much) and what it might take to swap back (a lot more.) [Note: Don’t miss part two of this interview, which addresses BfA regrets, Shadowlands complexity and more on alts.] Ion Hazzikostas: If you just want to try a different experience or you regret your choice... [let’s say] you hit max level, you think the Venthyr are awesome, you join the Venthyr. And you know what, you decide that vampire parties are lame, and you want no part of them and you want to join the Kyrian — totally not vampires, but you know what I mean. You want to join the Kyrian, you know what, you can go do that. You can say, I made a mistake, I’m going to join the Kyrian. You snap your fingers, and you're now a Kyrian. That's okay. But the Venthyr will remember that. The Venthyr are not going to take too kindly to the fact that you entered into this sacred oath with them and then broke it to go off and join the Kyrian. Hazzikostas: The way that the way we have that set up, there are actually pretty robust catch-up mechanisms, whether you are just an alt, you're someone who picks up Shadowlands a few months after release, or you're switching from one covenant to another. There shouldn't be a feeling of a tremendous grind involved to get yourself up to speed. Where we’re focusing the friction is not on changing covenants the first time, but in returning to a covenant that you've left. Traveling between covenant areas in World of Warcraft: Shadowlands (shown) is a lot easier than ... [+] swapping your allegiances. Newman: All right, so let’s say I regret my choices and swap back. What do I have to do? Hazzikostas: So if you want to rejoin the Venthyr, you will need to atone for your transgressions. And we haven't tuned that, exactly. But think of a series of turn-ins, basically, having to prove your dedication to them. Sorry, yeah, you made a mistake, you thought the grass was greener on the other side of the fence, you thought the Kyrian and their wings were awesome. Actually, you want to come back and you want to host your parties again. And they'll believe you, and let you back in. Hazzikostas: Everything is there as you left it. If you had your sanctum unlocked at a certain Renown level and certain Soulbinds, those are all preserved and waiting for you. Hazzikostas: Really, the goal here is to make sure that we're not punishing anyone for feeling a sense of regret or for wanting to explore their choices. But we really don't want this to turn into a system where you're changing back and forth, where you feel like our guild is progressing on this boss, I'm going to go Kyrian, and then switch to that boss and be Ardenweald or Night Fae. At that point, it's not an expression of identity anymore. It's just another one of those options that you're dialing in as part of a load-out: like your talents, and what gear you've equipped, and what Soulbind you have active, and the path within your Soulbind that you've chosen. All of those things we intend to be fully malleable. There's a vast array of choice and customization there. Ion Hazzikostas in the video call. Hazzikostas: Choosing a covenant is in some ways, systemically, like choosing a subclass. Are you a Venthyr paladin, or are you a Kyrian paladin? It should be a big choice. Now we recognize that with a big choice comes a lot of obligation, and we don't take that lightly. Obviously, from a balancing perspective, it's on us to make those difficult and meaningful and complex choices. So far, players have mostly just been focusing on the active abilities that they have seen. We don't claim that those activities are all perfectly balanced against each other, because in some cases we know they can't be. Two different types of utility or different types of throughput, one might have a better single-target component, one might have a better AOE component, but that's not the choice players are being asked to make. Hazzikostas: Players are being asked to make a choice between a large package of options, including all the different Soulbind talents, covenant-specific perks, what’s available through conduits or [legendary items] and those active abilities. And that gives us enough tuning knobs that we feel pretty confident that we can muddy the waters such that there’s no clear right or wrong answer for the game as a whole, even for a particular type of content as a whole. If a friend asks you, and they like playing ranged classes in RPGs or MMOs, should I play a mage or a hunter, which is better? Honestly? Both are really good, both have great perks and benefits. Someone who is a top-tier Hall of Fame raider would tell you that, and someone who is a [Mythic Dungeon International] competitor would tell you that. It really comes down to which one you think is cooler, which is more fun. Try them both out, see what speaks to you more. Yes, if you try to compare like, is [the spell] Blink better than Disengage? Well, yeah, it probably is. It goes further, it has a shorter cooldown. There are all these reasons why it's better. But you're not choosing Blink versus Disengage. You're choosing the entire package of mage versus the entire package of hunter. And that's the space we want covenants and covenant choice to occupy. The Kyrian Sanctum in World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. Hazzikostas: When it comes to nerfs or tuning once it’s live, obviously we need to be very careful there. We don't want to upset the balance or create a sense of regret where there previously wasn't one. I think something that helps here is that, at the end of the day, covenants are important. They're impactful. But they're not the lion’s share of your power. Your class is the lion share of your power, and we have no intention of changing that. Maybe this is a little bit of a flippant answer, but we certainly make balance changes to classes and specs, and you can't change your class very easily, without fully leveling up or rolling a new character. And that ends up being okay. Outside of very high-end or niche gameplay, people don’t constantly feel the need to change or re-roll their class from tier to tier. We do carefully want to make sure that we're not taking something that used to be the best at a certain situation and make it the worst, but we're always looking to shrink gaps. Newman: What are you doing to avoid those large changes? Players are a crafty bunch, and we keep finding new ways to combine advantages. Hazzikostas: Part of our goal in getting the system out there early, part of our goal in unlocking testing of all 48 active abilities in alpha even before the associated zones were available, is to start getting early feedback as soon as possible — both on the feel of these abilities, but also their tuning, so that the likelihood of changes we have to make after the game is live is as low as possible. But yes, as you note, players are clever. In [Battle for Azeroth] people are figuring out some new variant builds for some of our specs almost two years into the expansion. So that's always fun. Hazzikostas: I mean, anything's possible. I think that would be probably a last resort. It's hard to imagine a change quite as sweeping as that. I think when talent tree refunds or free respecs were offered in the old days, it wasn't really for balance changes, typically. It was often because something fundamental was redesigned about a tree. This talent was changed and replaced with a brand new one entirely. If we ended up doing something that was a fundamental change to how aspects of covenants work, we’d probably consider something like that. But hey, we reduced the range of Door of Shadows by five yards, we’re probably not going to let you change covenants, right? Not that we’re contemplating making that particular change, but that's the sort of thing I'm thinking of. Night Fae headquarters in World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. Newman: It’s been a long time — maybe since the advent of the transmogrification system in 2011 — since players have been locked into a particular aesthetic look when making choices about power. Why link them together again? Why not let players earn the looks of all of the covenants? Hazzikostas: It's definitely definitely a conscious choice on our part to marry form and function in this regard. I think there are other places where that occurs; races and racial abilities in WoW are fair example. Some people pick their race as a result purely of which sims best; others, even if they're competitive players... I have a guild mate, an excellent mythic raider. There are situations where he knows that goblin would be better mechanically for certain encounters and situations, but [he] refuses to go goblin, like, “Nope, not going to do it,” because the aesthetic is too big a sacrifice in his mind. And that's a totally valid choice. In my opinion, I think these are hard choices. And to some extent, that's okay to look at two things and say, well, I really want this one from this column. And I really want that thing from that column. Why can't I have both? Newman: That’s a good question. Why can’t you? Hazzikostas: Sometimes you can, a lot of the time you can, but sometimes you can't, and that can make for meaningful and deep choices when it comes to aesthetics and appearances. It's part of covenant as an expression of identity, as opposed to something that is freely malleable. If you see a warrior wearing a full suit of radiant Kyrian plate, you know that that is a Kyrian, and that they're not going to suddenly use the red-tinged Venthyr Door of Shadows to move around. You're learning something about their identity, what they're capable of, and the choices they've made. The vast majority, the overwhelming 99.9 percent of transmog options have no such restrictions, but there is something to these particular symbols of the choices you've made being linked to that. It’s the same way there's class armor and old class sets that you could only wear if you were a rogue or if you were a mage. And even if you were a warlock who thought the mage set looked really cool, sorry, that's for mages, you're a warlock. These are, again, tiny exceptions to the default of everything being changeable, everything being accessible, but we feel like they are important to carve out and maintain as kind of stakes in the ground, carving out identity.

Darnell Sterling, 55, of Southeast Washington, was arrested Thursday night and charged with second-degree murder. The victim, Olga Ooro, 34, was discovered missing July 18 after someone found her 7-year-old son wandering a hallway alone and crying at their apartment near Mount Vernon Triangle in Northwest Washington. She had last been seen shortly after midnight on July 17. Police said in an arrest affidavit filed in D.C. Superior Court that surveillance video shows a man who fits the defendant’s description pushing a cart into an elevator and out of the building that held a large object which appeared to be wrapped in a blue and white blanket, and was “consistent with the size of an adult human being.” The affidavit says the suspect then drove to his residence in Southeast Washington, and then to Ocean City, Md. In addition, police said the suspect gave detectives statements that contradicted evidence, and Ooro’s cellphone, purse, apartment key fob and bedsheets are missing. Police said a cadaver dog alerted to possible human remains in Ooro’s apartment, in the hallway near her door and in the front passenger seat of the suspect’s Volkswagen Passat. Ooro’s mother, Timanah, said she is grateful there was an arrest but wants to know how to find her daughter. “I can’t even think anymore,” said the 60-year-old mother, who lives in Silver Spring, Md. “It’s so unbelievable. It’s like a nightmare.” Prosecuting a murder case without a body is rare but not unheard of. In 2017,  Jose Angel Rodriguez-Cruz pleaded guilty to killing Pamela Butler, who had disappeared from her District home in 2009. Under the plea agreement, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, in exchange for helping authorities locate Butler’s remains. Police determined the location had since been paved as part of the resurfacing of Interstate 95 in Virginia. On Friday, a D.C. Superior Court judge ordered Sterling detained and set a hearing for Aug. 26. At his initial appearance, Sterling stood in the well of the courtroom wearing shorts, a light blue shirt and a mask, with his legs and wrists in shackles. His court-appointed attorney Howard McEachern argued there is no evidence that Ooro is dead, and if she is deceased, he said there is no evidence as to how she died. He said there is evidence Ooro has used drugs in the past and she might have overdosed. The defense attorney said police searched Sterling’s car without a warrant and argued any evidence found could be inadmissible at trial, and that the police dog’s finding are not conclusive. He said it is possible Ooro left her apartment with someone else after his client departed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Liebman said Sterling was a risk to the community and should be detained. He said Sterling had nearly a dozen former convictions, including for assault and theft, and that he had violated a court order barring him from being in contact with Ooro. Ooro, a grocery store cashier, in April had complained to police that Sterling punched her during an argument at his residence, causing her cheek to swell and bloodying her eye. Assault charges are pending against Sterling in that case. Sterling told police he had been with Ooro at dinner the night of July 16, and they both returned to her apartment in the 300 block of Massachusetts Ave. NW shortly after midnight on July 17, according to the arrest affidavit. He said the couple had planned to go gambling, the affidavit said, and Ooro’s son told police his mother put him to bed and was wearing “fancy clothes.” But Sterling told police they started to argue shortly after leaving, and she decided not to accompany him. According to the affidavit, Sterling told police he drove to Ocean City, slept overnight on the beach and returned to the District the following day. He also said his cellphone was stolen as he slept. But police said license plate readers, such as ones placed on toll booths, show Sterling’s vehicle heading east over the Bay Bridge at 11:27 p.m. and entering Ocean City at 1:42 a.m. on July 17. It shows him leaving Ocean City that same day, at 8:17 p.m., heading back to the District. Police said that while at Ooro’s apartment, Sterling parked his vehicle in an alley and left its emergency flasher blinking for more than two hours and was also seen carrying a dark-colored trash bag to his vehicle.

police civil case,https://www.nj.com/crime/2020/07/teen-told-police-her-ex-choked-her-days-before-he-was-arrested-in-her-murder-authorities-say.html,"Teen told police her ex choked her days before he was arrested in her murder, authorities say","Bryan Gonzalez-Martines, 20, of Plainfield, is accused of strangling Brenda Montoya-Cruz to death. Brenda Montoya-Cruz, 19, told police her ex-boyfriend choked and threatened to kill her about a week before police found her strangled to death in her Plainfield apartment earlier this month, according to a criminal complaint in the case. Her ex-boyfriend, Bryan Gonzalez-Martines, was arrested July 7, a day after police entered her apartment for a wellness check and found her body, authorities said. Gonzalez-Martines, 20, now faces a first-degree murder charge. Gonzalez-Martines jumped from a second-floor roof of a three-story home outside Montoya-Cruz’s window when police arrived at the apartment on the 700 block of Kensington Avenue on July 6, the complaint said. Gonzalez-Martines, of Plainfield, was later identified to police by a juvenile who lived next door to Montoya-Cruz. The complaint did not specify how Gonzalez-Martines was apprehended or where he fled. His wallet was found inside the apartment, the complaint said. Montoya-Cruz went to the Plainfield Police Division on June 30 to tell them her ex-boyfriend had attacked her and threatened her life, but she declined to get a restraining order, authorities said in the charging document. Authorities charged him with aggravated assault after that incident. Gonzalez-Martines’ own father spurred the wellness check that led police to find the 19-year-old’s body. His father called police around 8:21 a.m. on July 6 to tell them his son had phoned and said he had done “something bad,” the charging document said. The father told police where Montoya-Cruz lived. The father later provided a sworn statement to authorities and said he spoke with his son at approximately 3:30 a.m., the complaint said. “…[H]is son told him he got into a fight with his girlfriend and did something ‘grave,’” the complaint said. Gonzalez-Martines’ father told police he tried calling his son numerous times over the next several hours, but no one responded. On Monday, Gonzalez-Martines appeared before Superior Court Judge Thomas Isenhour remotely from the Union County Jail for a detention hearing. He consented to being detained through a translator and was represented by a public defender. His next court appearance is scheduled for Aug. 19, jail records show. Our journalism needs your support.

police civil case,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Connecticut-House-approves-police-accountability-15431393.php,Eyes turn to Senate after House passes police reform bill,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Critics of a wide-ranging police accountability proposal that passed the House of Representatives after an all-night special session debate Friday, now plan to turn their attention to the state Senate, which is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the wide-ranging legislation sparked by the death of George Floyd and other Black citizens. Organizations representing municipalities across the state warned that a retooled, contentious section of the bill concerning limiting legal immunity protections for officers still puts cities and towns at risk for potentially higher legal and insurance costs if an officer is sued civilly for violating someone's constitutional rights. “We will be continuing to call on state senators to delete that provision,” said Betsy Gara, executive director of the Council of Small Towns, acknowledging, however, that it's “unlikely” the Democratic-controlled Senate will make any changes to the bill considering the House, also controlled by Democrats, has now adjourned. There's a possibility lawmakers may return for a second special session in September. The next regular session begins in January. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities on Friday also raised concerns about potential costs to cities and towns stemming from other parts of the bill, including language that only justifies a police officer using force if they've exhausted all reasonable alternatives. After hours of sometimes emotionally charged debate in a nearly empty House chamber, given the social distancing measures, the bill passed 86-58. It came a day after hundreds of police officers rallied at the state Capitol to protest portions they said will ultimately lead to more retirements, recruitment challenges and officers not responding to calls. Proponents, on the other hand, emphatically argued the legislation is long past due, given the racial inequities in the state and the injustices minority residents experience daily. “For me, this isn’t a philosophical question. This isn’t some issue of town rights or some issue of money or local control. It’s a matter of life and death,” said Rep. Pat Wilson Pheanious, D-Ashford, who is Black. “It’s a matter of being treated like a whole American.” Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, a Black police officer who helped to negotiate the legislation, described how he's been followed and warned by fellow officers in recent weeks to “be careful” and to “watch what I say."" He expressed frustration that even though changes were made to accommodate officers who feared losing their homes or a child's college savings in a lawsuit, ensuring they would not be financially liable, critics still weren't satisfied. “And now people are worried about the burden on the municipalities? Don't get me wrong, there will be an increase. But the municipality already owns that burden,"" said Nolan, who implored his legislative colleagues to “vote with your heart, not your head.” An amendment to delete the immunity provision from the bill failed on a rare tie vote in the House. The police accountability bill was originally negotiated between Democrats and Republicans, with the hope there could be a bipartisan response to the demands for police reform. House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby, tearfully spoke about her disappointment with how the debate had devolved into “picking sides” between the police and minorities who've been harmed by the police. “I believe we all wanted to make this work. I had faith in it,” she said of the negotiations. But she said the final version of the bill will ultimately impede the ability of police officers to do their jobs. Besides allowing civil lawsuits against officers by individuals who've had their constitutional rights violated by the police whose actions were “malicious, wanton or willful,” the bill reforms police practices and training. It includes a new inspector general to investigate police use-of-force cases, periodic mental health screenings for officers, new limits on circumstances in which deadly use of force is justified, mandatory body cameras for all officers in the state and imposes limits on military-style equipment for local departments. The proposal also would limit the use of chokeholds and other restraints that impair breathing and require officers to intervene when they see other officers using excessive force and report the misconduct to their superiors. Bridgeport Democratic Rep. Steve Stafstrom, co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called the bill a “comprehensive package that will bring much-needed, commonsense transparency and accountability into Connecticut’s police departments.” “The bill before us is not anti-cop,” he said. ""We understand that change is hard, but oftentimes, change is also necessary.” Associated Press writer Dave Collins contributed to this report."
police civil case,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-bali-marcus-beam-arrested-20200724-laybhnbm3jdlfkchcajl7itknq-story.html,"Police in Bali arrest DuPage County man wanted in an investment fraud case brought in Chicago, saying he escaped on bogus passport","DENPASAR, INDONESIA — Authorities on the Indonesian resort-laden island of Bali have arrested an American fugitive accused of investment fraud in the United States involving hundreds of thousands of dollars, police said Friday. Bali police chief Petrus Reinhard Golose said the suspect, Marcus Beam, had been making and selling sex videos in Bali to support his living expenses there. He said Beam apparently escaped from the U.S. by using a passport with a different name and entered Bali in January. Beam was arrested with his American girlfriend in a villa in Badung late Thursday based on a notice from Interpol, Golose said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on its website that Beam, of Woodridge, Illinois, is accused of misappropriating about $500,000 from investors that was supposed to be placed in investment funds. Instead of investing the money, Beam spent it on personal and business expenses, it said. To conceal the misappropriation, he sent fraudulent account statements to investors, and did not return any money when they attempted to redeem their investments, the SEC said. It said it filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in Chicago last September. Beam was paraded in handcuffs and a face mask at a police news conference on Friday in Denpasar, the Bali provincial capital. Police presented evidence they seized including passports, a folding knife, 14 sex toys, five cellphones and 13 other electronic devices. “He has made various sex videos and sold it to online sites to support his living expenses while in Bali,” Golose said. “We are still investigating whether he involved local people in those videos, but so far the crime he committed was only in his homeland.” He said Beam had moved about seven times and used several identities while in Bali. He used a passport bearing the name of Demario Faulkner and told police he was on vacation, Golose said. Golose said there is no extradition agreement between Indonesia and the U.S., but the two nations have police-to-police cooperation arrangements that would enable Beam to be deported to his homeland."

sheriff civil case,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/24/texas-sheriffs-department-made-live-pd-more-dramatic/5498349002/,How a Texas sheriff's department used a SWAT team to make 'Live PD' more dramatic,"AUSTIN – Williamson County sheriff’s SWAT officers in high-tech helmets and military fatigues leapt from an armored vehicle and rushed toward the limestone cottage. The first deputy on the front porch swung a battering ram into the wood-framed front door. A second ignited a smoke bomb on the front steps as five SWAT officers screaming “Arrest warrant! Arrest warrant!” moved inside, trailed by a German shepherd in a bulletproof vest. Within minutes, Asher Watsky was slammed against a wall as cameras strategically positioned to capture a high-drama arrest panned the scene for the reality TV show “Live PD.” The highly weaponized arrest came just 3½ hours after Watsky sat peacefully in a courtroom where deputies had ample opportunity to take him into custody without fanfare. Watsky, whose alleged offense was ending an argument by hitting his roommate with a shovel, had strolled in and out of the Williamson County Justice Complex for a routine pretrial appearance that afternoon as he had done for months. He had passed through metal detectors under the watchful eyes of armed sheriff’s deputies. Inside the courtroom on a charge related to his roommate altercation, Watsky was a few feet from armed bailiffs who work for Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody. Both Watksy’s lawyer and the county’s chief prosecutor say sheriff’s officials never intended to arrest Watsky quietly that day. In fact, the warrant executed in his home-invasion takedown on May 2, 2019, had been issued 15 days earlier. But when it was entered into a local law enforcement database run by the sheriff’s office, someone had intentionally coded it as “inactive” — a command that made it invisible to anyone authorized to access the database. Without a way to see that Watsky had a pending warrant, no one outside a close circle of sheriff’s department officials could have followed the normal procedure of arresting Watsky on the spot. Watsky says he had no idea he was wanted until deputies burst into his father’s house and dragged him out in handcuffs that night. Watsky, his attorney and others say they are left with the troubling suspicion that his high-risk takedown was staged for TV. “There is no doubt about it,” said Gary Watsky, a retired financial adviser who was horrified watching the arrest of his only child. The firepower brought to Watsky’s arrest is the latest in a recent string of incidents deepening concerns about Williamson County law enforcement. Other area officials, legal experts and civil rights advocates are increasingly worried that Chody’s department resorts to excessive force and overly aggressive tactics in what should be routine and non-violent police work — sometimes to create dramatic television. Three former investigators told the American-Statesman that, as recently as six months ago, sheriff’s department leaders pressured them to draw up arrest warrants on suspects for “Live PD” production, even though they were still working the cases. “They would come back there quite often and say they wanted a juicy warrant, something that would look good on TV,” said former Williamson County Detective Casey Daley, who left the agency in November after eight years to become a full-time mother. Chody and the department did not respond to interview requests. Several deputies — and the sheriff’s department as a whole — have been under mounting scrutiny since the American-Statesman and KVUE-TV last month reported details of the death of Javier Ambler. Ambler, a black 40-year-old father, was chased for 22 minutes by two deputies with “Live PD” crews in their patrol cars after he failed to dim his headlights and fled. After Ambler crashed his car, deputies shocked him four times with a Taser as he screamed that he had a heart condition, couldn’t breathe and cried “save me.” Prosecutors and an outside law enforcement agency are investigating at least five other use-of-force cases. Those include an incident broadcast live on the reality show as deputies kicked, Tased and punched Ramsey Mitchell after he tried to run away. In Watsky’s case, law enforcement experts say, the sheriff’s department ignored law enforcement best practices when deputies inexplicably bypassed a chance to take him into custody in the more controlled, safer environment of the county courthouse. “Whenever you enter someone’s home, their home is their castle,” said Jeff Noble, a national law enforcement consultant and former deputy chief in Irvine, California. “There could be children inside. There could be uninvolved adults inside. Bad things happen when we run inside a home we aren’t familiar with with guns.” Williamson County District Attorney Shawn Dick told the Statesman that he discussed the Watsky case with sheriff’s officials last summer, and they “acknowledged they removed the warrant from the system” before arresting him in the televised takedown. Dick said the officials claimed that Watsky was being arrested on a violent felony warrant and was considered “a high-risk suspect” based on an internal sheriff’s department risk assessment matrix. They insisted that deploying the SWAT team to arrest him in a quiet, starter-home neighborhood of Cedar Park was not only prudent but necessary. “I said, ‘Threat matrix aside, it appears to me the safest and most efficient way to arrest someone is in the courtroom,’ ” Dick recalled. Worries about the sheriff’s relationship with “Live PD” have swirled among some Williamson County leaders for more than a year. Those worries surfaced May 21, 2019, when county commissioners debated whether the county would continue a contract with the highly rated cable show. Commissioner Valerie Covey grilled Chody, questioning whether his deputies were “delaying warrants and other issues that come about so that the camera can film it,” she said. “I’m just asking in general, ’Do we delay, do we do anything different in our process?” Chody responded: “No, not that I am aware of, no. Commissioners voted to terminate the show’s contract three months later. Chody soon drafted his own agreement, allowing “Live PD” to resume filming. That led commissioners to sue the sheriff. In June, “Live PD” ended production two days after the Statesman’s report on Ambler’s death and amid national protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. The three former sheriff’s employees said they were deeply troubled by demands to get arrest warrants in time for “Live PD” production. All said they believed the requests were unethical. They also feared the imperative to get good TV storylines and images for the reality cameras harmed criminal investigations. Gil Unger, who worked his last of nine years in the department’s criminal investigations division before resigning last fall, said that, in several instances, he wanted to pursue more evidence before making an arrest. Unger recalled two cases when he had not yet contacted alleged perpetrators to check their alibis or heard their accounts of what happened, possibly ruling them out as suspects or taking an investigation in a new direction. He said he no longer remembers the names of those defendants and hasn’t followed their cases. “I didn’t like it at all,” Unger said. “I let my supervisors know, and I think the response was, ‘I know dude. That is the way it is.’” Until the reality TV show began working with the sheriff, Daley said, she and other detectives routinely got suspects to surrender at the Williamson County Jail. In other instances, she said, she and another detective would go arrest the target of an investigation themselves — a practice she said supervisors discouraged after the TV show came to town. Though the supervisors said they didn’t think that was safe, Daley said, ’“we knew it wasn’t for our safety.” Mike Klier, who served as president of the Williamson County Deputies Association and worked in the special victims unit for two years, said he and his colleagues referred to their supervisors as “shopping for Live PD” when the show was set to film. Klier, who was fired in June after supervisors claimed he was untruthful about whether he received a directive relating to evidence in a case, recalled a child sex abuse case in which there was little evidence other than the word of a young accuser. Klier said in that case, a colleague was having ongoing conversations with a suspect, trying to build a rapport he hoped would lead to a confession, when supervisors ordered him to move forward with an arrest. The suspect refused to cooperate once he was in jail, Klier said. “You work really hard on these cases, and you are trying to make sure everything is perfect for them,” Klier said. “It puts your entire investigation at risk, not only for you but justice for the victim.” Nationally, military-style police raids have faced harsh criticism. Fearing for the safety of officers and the public, many police agencies now turn to such tactics only when other efforts to detain a suspect failed. Much of the controversy has focused on what police call “no-knock” search warrants. The aggressive, surprise actions are authorized when investigators believe that announcing themselves before entering a home for a court-authorized search might give suspects too much time to destroy evidence and violently resist. Critics say police too often misuse the tactic with thin evidence to justify searches, and the raids often fail to produce prosecutable violations. The March death of Breonna Taylor by Louisville, Kentucky, police during a no-knock drug raid sparked national outrage. In that case, drug investigators raided the house in search of Taylor’s ex-boyfriend. Walker’s current boyfriend believed the officers were intruders and opened fire. The officers shot back, killing Taylor. Police found no drugs. The Houston Police Department is grappling with fallout from a botched January 2019 raid. Officers burst into a home to search for black-tar heroin, and gunfire erupted, killing two middle-aged homeowners and their dog and injuring four officers. Investigators say they later determined the lead investigator lied and faked evidence to justify the raid. He now faces murder charges, and five other officers face related charges for civil rights violations, falsifying evidence and trying to covering up their actions. Experts say forcible entries to arrest suspects already charged with crimes provoke less controversy because officers have provided a judge with evidence to support the charge, often a violent felony. Whether police are serving a search warrant or arresting a suspect, both operations generally rely on the same tactics and tools. They also carry similar risks. Experts say the inherent danger of surprising a homeowner has increasingly made officers balance the need to arrest a suspect with keeping themselves and the public safe. Noble said most departments first try less aggressive means: Undercover officers often conduct surveillance and nab a suspect arriving or leaving home or work. They may follow the suspect and make a traffic stop. They may do a “surround and call out,” ringing the perimeter of a house and using a megaphone to order the suspect to come out and surrender. Texas agencies are not required to report how often officers breach a home. Williamson County has not answered requests for such data. Hays County Sheriff Gary Cutler said his deputies “hardly ever” serve no-knock arrest warrants. “Going into houses like that can be pretty dangerous,” he said. Assistant Austin Police Chief Joe Chacon said officers often coordinate with the U.S. Marshal’s Service and try to find less dangerous ways to arrest suspects. “We always look for situations where we can place our officers, the public and the person we need to arrest in the lowest risk,” Chacon said. “We generally like to avoid going into a house if it is at all possible.” The Watskys moved into their four-bedroom home seven years ago. By then, Asher Watsky had finished his freshman year at Westwood High School before transferring to a Montana boarding school. He enrolled in college in Arizona but came home after his mother was diagnosed with cancer. Watsky took orders at a couple of fast-food spots, got an apartment with a roommate a few miles from his parents’ home and helped tend to his mother. Along the way, police arrested him for misdemeanor marijuana possession in 2015, a charge later dismissed. Watsky’s mother died in August 2018. Less than two weeks later, court records show he and his roommate had two violent arguments. Police arrested Watsky after the roommate told detectives they got into a fight on Sept. 9 over a stick of deodorant. The roommate told police the fight left him with bruises to his chest, neck and a busted lip. The roommate also reported that Watsky had assaulted him days earlier. On his lawyer’s advice, Watsky declined to discuss what happened with the Statesman. He still faces related charges. Within days of the September altercation, he was arrested on a family violence charge and was released on bond. Over the next eight months, Watsky reported to court once a month and followed the conditions of his pretrial release. “Anything they asked, I was willing to do,” he said. “Go to court about once a month and make sure I am there. Go to therapy sessions. Passing drug tests. Just doing my best.” He and his father went to the Williamson County Courthouse May 2, 2019, for a routine 1:30 p.m. court hearing. Watsky’s lawyer, Brad Vinson, was in trial on another case upstairs but arranged for Watksy to see the judge without him. Watsky went into a first-floor courtroom, signed a form and left the courthouse with his father around 3:30 p.m. They stopped at Home Depot and a barbershop for haircuts on the way home. But unbeknownst to Watsky or Vinson, a new arrest warrant had been issued in the case a month earlier when a grand jury returned two indictments charging Watsky with family violence and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The second indictment alleged Watsky had used a shovel to assault the roommate five days before the Sept. 9 incident. The indictment generated the new arrest warrant. Such warrants are routed to Chody’s staff, who are responsible for entering them into law enforcement databases and carrying out arrests when possible. The night of Watsky’s televised arrest, “Live PD” cameras cut to Williamson County sheriff’s Detective Mark Luera bouncing on the back of the armored vehicle as it rumbled east along Discovery Drive. Luera deadpanned for the camera about Watsky’s dangerousness. Nothing the detective told the TV show is supported by court documents or publicly available law enforcement records. “He does have an extensive history for narcotics use. He, uh, obviously, he’s got a background of violence. So, uh, they, uh, requested that we come out and serve this warrant on him,” Luera explained. “He was outside prior to, smoking what we’re gonna — we are going to say were narcotics — because that’s heavy use,” Luera added as the camera panned behind to show a convoy of black police vehicles trailed by an ambulance. “Once again, a very dangerous subject, because of his history and his narcotics use., We just don’t know what, ah, what he’s going to do at this point,” Luera continued for the camera. “He was outside smoking something. Like I said, we’re gonna go ahead and think that he was outside smoking something illegal.” “Nice and easy, nice and easy!” the detective called to a driver. “That’s his silver car right there! Nice and easy!” Inside the home, the Watskys had just placed an online order for Chinese food. Asher Watsky was in the bathroom and heard a crash. He thought his father had fallen. “I ran out, and couldn’t even get halfway out of the bathroom, and there were just a bunch of military guys, barking dogs,” he said. “It freaked me out really bad.” Gary Watsky was in a middle room of the house. He recalled barely having time to look up before “every room in the house was covered with people in assault gear.” He heard his son yelling: “Dad! Dad! Dad!′ And they were telling him to just be quiet.” “I was telling him, ‘Look, whatever they tell you to do, just do what they want,’” he said. Before deputies ordered him to be quiet, Watsky told his son, ""‘Stay calm. Whatever they ask, just do it.’"" The final “Live PD” footage before the show cut back to its New York studio captured an officer instructing others to march Asher Watsky into the front room so he could be patted down on camera. “Alright bring him out here. Hold him right here,” someone called before an officer moved Watsky to a living room wall. Someone turned on lights in the room as Watsky was positioned a few feet from the camera. In knee-length blue basketball shorts and a black T-shirt, hands cuffed behind his back, Watsky looked bewildered in the final shot. Noble, who reviewed the video for the Statesman, said deputies “appeared to be avoiding basic tactics” during Watsky’s arrest. Given the severity of the allegations against Watsky, he said, “that is not the type of situation to take lightly, but at the same it is not the type of situation I would expect a SWAT team to enter a home to make an arrest.” The morning after the arrest, Watsky’s defense lawyer went to state District Judge Donna King, livid. The lawyer recalled the judge assuring him that no one on her staff saw that Watsky had a new arrest warrant in the law enforcement database. That raised his suspicion that his client had been targeted for a TV takedown. King said she could not comment on the case because it is still pending in her court. Gary Watsky said the raid left his home with thousands of dollars in damage. A permanent charred spot on the front porch left by a smoke bomb serves as a reminder of what he believes was law enforcement gone awry. “I was appalled, and I felt violated,” Gary Watsky said. “This is not America. Most people don’t deserve to be treated this way, no matter what.”"

          Pandemic delays case of man held in Alabama sheriff slaying","HAYNEVILLE, Ala. (AP) - The coronavirus pandemic is delaying the case of a man charged in the shooting death of an Alabama sheriff last year. Court proceedings are on hold in Lowndes County, which has the state’s highest virus infection rate, so grand jurors have yet to take up the case of William Chase Johnson, 18, who is charged with capital murder in the shooting death last November of Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams. The Montgomery Advertiser reported that this month’s grand jury session was canceled because of the pandemic and an investigation is continuing. That means it will likely be early next year before a grand jury reviews the shooting. Williams was shot in the face while attempting to break up a loud gathering at a convenience store in Hayneville. Johnson, who has not entered a plea, is being held without bond. A gag order issued in the case means attorneys cannot comment outside of court proceedings or in court documents. Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC."

Ada Wong, the lawyer representing Paul Barracliffe, called the incident a ""vicious attack."" The lawsuit claims the sheriff’s office’s “reckless conscious disregard for the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, have caused Plaintiff Paul Barracliffe II to suffer deprivation of his civil and constitutional rights, physical injury, and severe mental and emotional distress.” According to the lawsuit, Fortney was a sergeant at the time of Barracliffe's arrest, and was one of the seven law enforcement officers who responded to the call. On Sept. 26, 2018, Barracliffe’s mother called 911 for a mental health wellness check on her 32-year-old son. Barracliffe had suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2008 and was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to his attorney. “It was late at night and he was sitting on his couch, watching TV and police officers came,” Wong said. According to the lawsuit, officers arrived at the home, threw Barracliffe on the ground and repeatedly punched and used tasers on him. Barracliffe did not resist arrest, according to Wong. “They put a bag over him and walked him outside and that’s when one of the officers released his canine dog to hold onto Paul’s foot,” Wong said. The lawsuit is filed against Snohomish County, Fortney and several other deputies. One of those deputies is Arthur Wallin. A month after this case, Deputy Wallin was fired for a separate use-of-force case, where he shot and killed 24-year-old Nickolas Peters following a chase by Snohomish County deputies in October 2018. When Fortney was elected sheriff this year, he reinstated Wallin. “With what the situation he was put in that night, I find his actions reasonable,” Fortney said in a January 2020 press conference about hiring back Wallin. While the reinstatement is not the direct reason the lawsuit was filed Wong said her client is concerned that Wallin was let back onto the force. “It doesn’t necessarily play into why they filed a lawsuit. The lawsuit was brought because what they did was absolutely wrong,” she said. “For Sheriff Fortney to reinstate him, we think is absolutely reckless. They’re not taking any responsibility, they’re not making any changes and they’re putting our citizens at risk,” Wong said. Barracliffe is seeking $5 million in damages. “They’re not taking responsibility and there is no change. It’s affected him emotionally it’s affected him mentally and I think it’s going to affect him probably for the rest of his life,"" Wong said. The Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office told KING 5 they cannot comment on pending legal matters. A public records request for documents related to this case is pending."

(WSAW) - The City of Wausau and Village of Rothschild publicly have strained relationships with the Wausau Central Wisconsin Convention and Visitors Bureau following actions taken by the CVB’s executive director in regards to delinquent room tax funds. Rothschild ultimately terminated its contract after it determined that the CVB did not produce contract elements its commission asked to receive. The CVB’s future with Wausau is yet to be seen. See the previous report here. Wausau filed a complaint with the Marathon County Sheriff’s Office June 17, accusing executive director Dick Barrett of “theft by fraud.” An investigation took place and the case was ultimately closed and the complaint unfounded, but several municipal leaders questioned why no municipalities were interviewed in the process. The CVB’s attorney during Rothschild’s tourism commission meeting Monday also mentioned that the case has been reopened, but according to the investigator’s supervisor, Det. Lt. Jeff Stefonek, the case has not been reopened. Here is his explanation of the investigation process and why the case ended the way it did. In NewsChannel 7′s previous report, Rothschild was noted to not have responded to Expedia until June (this was also noted in the sheriff’s office’s investigation). Village administrator, Gary Olsen said Tuesday that was because the message was received by the village’s new treasurer right as the COVID-19 pandemic began causing massive changes to Wisconsin entities. Olsen said at that time employees were broken up into two groups and asked to work in the office every other week and the email got lost in the group of emails from that time. Olsen questioned why Expedia did not try to reach out by phone, especially since emails can get sent to spam folders without the recipient’s knowledge, or why Barrett did not reach out to the municipalities before he contacted Expedia. “We would not have allowed him to collect the Village’s room tax revenue,” Olsen said. “The State Statutes (sic) are very clear that the room tax dollars are to be paid directly to the municipality.” Copyright 2020 WSAW.

","The spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, who's position was just eliminated by the Minneapolis City Council on Friday, told 5 INVESTIGATES his initial statement about George Floyd's death was wrong, but based on information he believed to be correct at the time. John Elder, whose formal title is Public Information Officer, could not say why that account was so drastically different from the cellphone video of Floyd's death. At least some city council members cited it as a reason to eliminate Elder's position and instead shift that role to city hall. But 5 INVESTIGATES found it is part of a larger pattern at MPD. In a review of nearly 100 legal settlements involving excessive force at MPD, 5 INVESTIGATES found in more than one out of four of those cases, an officer was accused of falsifying police reports, omitting key details or failing to document the use of force altogether. The department initially declined to comment on the story, saying it was part of an investigation. Michelle Gross, the head of Communities United Against Police Brutality in Minneapolis, said her group's criticism is even more warranted based on the pattern identified. ""I was really glad that you brought that out,"" she said. ""Police are attempting to justify what they have done to people and reduce the liability on part of the agency that they work for… they shouldn't just believe anything that comes out of their mouth."" Earlier this week, state lawmakers celebrated what they called historic police reforms that passed at the capital, including requirements on use of force reporting. But Gross, and other critics, do not believe it goes far enough. ""Not even close. Our organization along with our coalition partners are all deeply disappointed in this legislation. This was the lowest of low hanging fruit. It did not even begin to address the concerns that we had about policing and police accountability,"" she said. The calls for accountability continue to grow louder. On Friday, Minneapolis attorney Bob Bennett sent a letter accusing the city of protecting the identities of the officers who shot non-lethal rounds at two people protesting Floyd's death back in May, causing serious injuries. Bennett said one of his clients was permanently blinded by the rubber bullet that an MPD officer fired at him. ""Shielding the identities only contributes to the mistrust of the MPD. Further, it gives credence to the widely held belief that MPD officers act with impunity – think blue wall of silence,"" Bennett wrote in the six-page letter. It goes on to read ""the attorney's office should play no role in deepening the mistrust of the MPD, particularly now."" A spokesman for the city attorney's office said the city cannot release the identities of the officers, citing public records laws.

police brutality,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/what-it-s-like-to-play-a-victim-of-police-brutality-on-screen/ar-BB176sn5,What it's like to play a victim of police brutality on screen,"LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - During the early days of Black Lives Matter protests, Algee Smith took to Instagram Live to express his feelings about the state of the world in the wake of George Floyd's death. He shared the emotional toll of acting in films that portray police brutality, saying that he no longer wanted to take on those robes but instead roles that are ""edifying a Black man."" ""I was obviously in a very emotional place. However, it was a very honest place,"" Smith says during Variety's #Represent: Black Men in Hollywood roundtable. ""I feel like I've played so many roles where I've either died as a young Black teenager or where it's been something that hasn't been edifying a Black teenager or a Black man at all. And so, I was like, for myself, I'm tired of playing those roles and I said 'I'm done with it.'"" At just 25-years-old, Smith has already taken on that emotional burden twice. In 2017's ""Detroit,"" Smith played Larry Reed, who endured a nightmarish experience of police abuse in a 1967 incident at the Algiers Motel. In 2018's ""The Hate U Give,"" Smith took on the role of Khalil, whose murder by a police officer during a traffic stop galvanizes the story's plot. ""I realize that it was educating, and it was cool to do,"" Smith says of those parts. ""But I want to see more roles where my little brother can look up and see a doctor or he can look up and see any type of role that we see anyone else play."" Though Smith doesn't have a completely negative view of those roles, that didn't make it easier to portray those experiences onscreen. ""It's not cool on set either, when you're hearing all types of things and you can't sleep,"" Smith recalls, describing the emotional weight of the experience. ""I had to take Ambien while I was shooting 'Detroit' because I couldn't sleep, because you're hearing that [abuse] 12 hours a day, and then you're just yelling and crying. But you do it for a reason. That's why we are actors, that's why we put ourselves in that position, to feel for people."" Smith shared his thought process during an intimate conversation with fellow actors Aldis Hodge (""City on a Hill""), Chris Chalk (""Perry Mason""), Derek Luke (""13 Reasons Why"") and Jay Pharoah (""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Bad Hair""). The virtual roundtable is the second installment of Variety's ""#Represent"" series, dedicated to the intersection of race, culture and Hollywood. And in sharing his experience, Smith learned he wasn't alone in questioning what roles he should be playing. In fact, the whole group have found themselves worrying about typecasting or fearing playing into Hollywood stereotypes at one time or another during their careers. ""It's very tough because you've got to trust the process, you've got to trust the project. But is this project going to serve, to elevate, the perception of my culture? Or does it serve the detriment of my culture? That is a responsibility that we carry, and it's often the risk we take, as entertainers, giving our portrayals,"" Hodge said. ""What most people don't get is that they don't see that, of the very specific roles that you've chosen, are probably about 80 and 90% of the roles that you had passed your way to get to those roles, were trash, trash, trash, trash."" Smith -- who is also known for his work on HBO's ""Euphoria"" and playing Ralph Tresvant in ""The New Edition Story"" -- went on to explain that he's been doing a great deal of introspection during the coronavirus shutdown about the art he hopes to create moving forward. ""When 2020 started, there was some weird energy going on that I felt, but when coronavirus happened, I kind of got angry. I got a little bit upset because I had a lot of things that I was working on that just stopped,"" Smith says. ""And I had to step back and look at it, and understand that, from my perspective, I think this [moment] is spiritual. And not just with coronavirus but also with what's going on with Black Lives [Matter] and what's going on with Black people, with our experience being felt by the world."" He continues, ""It's very deep to talk about, you can hear I'm kind of like getting angsty talking about it because it's just real. And when you kind of think about, it like, 'Okay, what is my part in this? What do I play?' I got to educate myself so I can know what to talk about, I got to educate myself so I can know what to do, what roles to take, what roles to write, what stuff to be a part of.""

Their training manual is 39 pages long and is full of laudable training goals and processes. The officer who assigned Mr. Chauvin to be the field training officer (FTO) for rookie officers flouted handbook policies. Why was an officer who had 18 complaints of excessive use of force in 19 years assigned to such a task? The training manual says, “The goal of the Minneapolis’ FTO Unit is to recruit, select and retain experienced officers of the highest caliber to serve as Field Training Officers and Field Training Sergeants.” The manual says the FTOs are “role models.” Was the assigner following the actual training policy? Did the assigner have any better choices than Mr. Chauvin? Reforming written policies and training manuals will not by themselves bring about just policing or justice to the criminal justice system in the United States. John E.

police brutality,https://www.inquirer.com/life/girls-dance-group-dallas-george-floyd-20200725.html,Girls dance group films video to confront racism and police brutality,"Shantrail White leads a group of girls dressed in black down Commerce Street in downtown Dallas. They pass boarded-up restaurants and stores spray-painted with phrases like “Black Lives Matter,” “No justice, no peace,” and “Now u see us.” Occasionally, they stop in front of one of these spots and raise their fists. It’s early June, the eighth day of protests in Dallas. But this group isn’t participating in those efforts. They’re filming a video in response to police brutality. Except for White, they’re all under the age of 14. White stops the girls and gathers them for a photo. Her shirt says, “I am a Black coach to Black kids on purpose.” White is the director of Elev8ed Elites Dance and Cheer Company, a team that normally practices in a studio in South Dallas. Since March, when the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in this country, they’ve rehearsed via Zoom to practice social distancing. But after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck until he died in May, the team wanted to make a statement. When White met virtually with the girls to see how they were doing, they said Floyd could have been their dad, uncle, or another family member. That’s when the idea for a video came up. “One of the dancers said that she wished we had competition so we could perform our ‘Gun Control’ piece,” White said. Earlier this year, Elev8ed Elites choreographed a dance called “Gun Control” in response to school shootings. The team pulled inspiration from that routine to create a dance for their police brutality video. Jordan Willis, 10, called the filming a day of remembrance for people who were shot by the police. Her mother, Crystal Willis, said that talking to Jordan about heavy topics has gotten easier. Last year, their conversations weren’t as smooth. “She would cry,” Crystal Willis said. “She didn’t want to go to so many places because of [mass shootings]. Now she’s more aware. “She’s still young, so sometimes she doesn’t understand, but my job as a parent is to help her understand. … That regardless of what we’re going through, we should love and treat everybody equally.” Fifty-eight girls dance on the Elev8ed Elites team, but they met downtown in groups of about 10 to practice social distancing while filming the video about police brutality. The team members wore masks, not only to prevent the spread of germs, but also to honor Black Americans who died at the hands of law enforcement. Tamia Franklin, 12, said she was dancing to support the Black Lives Matter movement. “[Police] need to stop killing us,” said Tamia, whose mask featured the name of Eric Garner. In 2014, a New York officer held Garner in a chokehold until he died after police suspected he was selling untaxed cigarettes. Marquita Anderson, Tamia’s mother, told her that before Floyd died on May 25 after repeating that he couldn’t breathe, Garner had previously said, “I can’t breathe.” That has become a prominent phrase in the Black Lives Matter movement. Before they filmed the video, which is now on the team’s YouTube and social media platforms, White made sure all the girls felt included. “We had a conversation to let them know, no matter what’s going on, we’re all dancers,” White said. “Everybody on the team is not Black, and I didn’t want anyone on the team to feel out of place or intimidated.” Some of the dancers have felt like outliers before. When Elev8ed Elites started three years ago, they performed at majorette-style competitions. White wanted the girls to experience competing in environments similar to those of historically Black colleges and universities. After the team traveled to New York in 2018 to tour the Juilliard School and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, they started focusing on ballet, jazz and modern dance. At modern competitions, Elev8ed Elites tends to be the only majority Black team. White said at their first event the girls instantly felt intimidated. “[I told them] we’re equal, no matter what,” White said. “We’ll get a fair chance, no matter what.” Zaria Fisher, 10, has been dancing with the team for two years. When they filmed the video, her mask featured the name of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by a Louisville Metro police officer in March. Zaria is the youngest of four siblings, so her mother, Tori Sears, is no stranger to the talk. “I always tell them, ‘We’re Black,’” said Sears, whose eldest son is 18. “We don’t have the same privileges as others.” After filming on Commerce Street, the girls walked in pairs to get shots in front of Renaissance Tower and on the red line DART train. White set the video to “Unholy War” by Jacob Banks. She chose the song because Banks’ music addresses societal issues. Just four days earlier, White had brought some of the dancers to the same spot on Commerce Street to see the aftermath of the protests. Co-captain Reign Villegas, 13, was disturbed after Floyd’s death. “She understands what happened. What she doesn’t understand is why it happened,” said Tracey Villegas, Reign’s mother. “For a long time [she] didn’t like her kinky, curly hair. ... For her to embrace who she is now and then see something like that — it hurt her.” Villegas, who identifies as Black and Hispanic, said that since Reign joined the team, her confidence has increased significantly. She attributes a lot of that change to White’s guidance. “She’s not just a dance coach, she’s a mentor for the team,” said Anderson, who pulled Tamia from another team to join Elev8ed Elites. “She has them learning about colleges; she’s promoting self-esteem. She’s about developing the total dancer.”"
police brutality,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/24/seattle-times-protesters-police-subpoena/,"Judge orders Seattle Times, four TV stations to give photos, videos of protests to police","On May 30, photographers from the Seattle Times and local TV stations aimed their cameras at an unruly crowd that had broken off from peaceful protests against police brutality and racial injustice. As the journalists documented the scene in downtown Seattle, the crowd smashed windows, set police cars on fire and looted businesses. Many of the perpetrators escaped arrest. But the Seattle Police Department had an idea how to try to find them: They demanded all the images shot that day by journalists on the scene. On Thursday, King County Superior Court Judge Nelson Lee ordered five news organizations to turn over the unpublished material, a decision that Times’s editors warned would gravely endanger reporters covering other protests. “The media exist in large part to hold governments, including law enforcement agencies, accountable to the public,” Michele Matassa Flores, the Times’s executive editor, told the paper. “We don’t work in concert with government, and it’s important to our credibility and effectiveness to retain our independence from those we cover.” Brian Esler, an attorney representing the police department, did not immediately return a message from The Washington Post on Thursday night. As President Trump prepares to send federal agents to Seattle to confront ongoing protests, an expansion of his contentious efforts in Portland, Ore., the judge’s ruling adds more tension to simmering protests that have been particularly intense throughout the Pacific Northwest. Inspectors general to examine law enforcement actions at Portland, D.C. protests The demonstrations in downtown Seattle on May 30 turned particularly destructive. Hundreds of peaceful protesters marched five days after George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis, shutting down Interstate 5 and then taking a stage downtown to denounce police violence. But at the same time, another group looted stores, launched fireworks at police and threw molotov cocktails. Five police cars were set on fire, and the vandals stole equipment, including tactical helmets and at least two guns that are still missing, the Times reported. Police later sent subpoenas to the Times and local stations KIRO, KOMO, KING, and KCPQ demanding all images shot over a 90-minute span in a four-block area downtown. In court, the department argued the raw footage “may be the best evidence available to identify” the suspects. The request could significantly harm journalists, the Times argued, at a time when reporters already face violence and distrust from protesters. One Times photographer was hit in the head with a rock thrown by a protester and punched in the face by another demonstrator, wrote Danny Gawlowski, the Times’s assistant managing editor, in an affidavit. “The perception that a journalist might be collaborating with police or other public officials poses a very real, physical danger to journalists, particularly when they are covering protests or civil unrest,” Gawlowski wrote. “Enforcing the subpoena also will aggravate the distrust journalist already face in covering protests.” Attorneys representing the media outlets also argued that the police’s request violates Washington state’s journalism shield law, which, in many cases, prevents the government from demanding source material from reporters and photographers. Since police didn’t actually know what other images had been captured that day, they have no way of knowing whether the material would actually help solve their case, attorney Eric Stahl argued in court filings. “We think there was too much speculation going on,” Stahl told the Times. But at a Thursday morning hearing, a Seattle police detective testified that the department hit a dead end after arresting two suspects, and that the media’s images were the only other evidence that might help find other perpetrators, the Times reported. Lee sided with the police. The judge found that the images are “highly material and relevant” and “critical or necessary” to solving the case, thus skirting the shield law’s protections. He did place limits on police, according to the Times, ruling that they could only use the photos and video to identify suspects who burned the police car and stole guns — not those involved in other more minor vandalism or looting. He also protected the reporters’ cellphone videos and photos. Flores, the Times editor, said on Thursday that the police department’s demand “puts our independence, and even our staff’s physical safety, at risk.” The paper is discussing whether to appeal, Flores said.

The idea for Black is Beautiful beer was created by Marcus B., founder and head brewer at Weathered Souls Brewing in San Antonio. He devised the recipe for the American Imperial Stout beer called ""Black is Beautiful."" So far, 1,037 breweries across all 50 U.S. states and 20 countries are brewing the beer and donating proceeds to organizations that help fight racial injustice and police brutality. Online, Marcus B. writes: ""As someone who has personally dealt with the abuse of power by the police, this recent turmoil the country is facing has hit home for me. As I write this, I contemplate how the country can move forward, how we as the people, can create change, and what it will take for everyone to move forward with a common respect for one another. For us, we feel that this is our contribution to a step."" Sometimes that’s all it takes for change. Sigma Brewing is the latest Houston-area craft brewer to answer the call to help. The local business, which is working overtime to keep its doors open during the pandemic, covered the cost of ingredients, packaging and labor an an effort to support real change. ""Our version is a American Imperial Stout. So that style is usually really big, sweet, dark chocolate notes,"" said co-owner Matt Peterson. ""High alcohol. It’s about 10 percent ABV."" Each 16-ounce 4-pack is priced at $20, and every cent made from the sale of Sigma Brewing's Black is Beautiful will be equally split among non-profit community organization Baker Ripley, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Your Rights Camp. ""I think that it’s really encouraging that all of us are striving to make positive changes in our neighborhoods,"" Peterson said. ""This is a difficult time for craft breweries in the state of Texas. We’re all effectively shutdown. But this issue is important enough to all of us that we, doesn’t matter what kind of financial loss we take, we need to contribute to it."" If you reach out to Sigma and they're sold out, go to www.BlackisBeautiful.beer. There you can find a list of craft brewers, including the more than 100 Texas businesses participating.

police brutality,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/24/police-violence-happens-against-women-too/,"Black women are the victims of police violence, too","On June 19, more than three months after white police officers in Louisville used a no-knock warrant to barge into the home of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, a black emergency room technician, shot her eight times and killed her, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced that he would fire one of the officers involved. Taylor’s slaying received little media attention until the killing of George Floyd three months later sparked massive protests about police violence toward African Americans. Yet while many of the most heavily covered stories of police violence involve black male victims, black women also have been long-standing victims of police violence, and they should also be centered in the fight against racism. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the only black woman in the Senate, tweeted, “We cannot forget about black women in our quest for justice.” Harris also tapped into activism against gendered police brutality by tweeting #SayHerName — a hashtag launched by the African American Policy Forum in 2015 as a way to commemorate the black women and girls killed at the hands of white law enforcement. The movement against gendered police brutality has a much longer history, however. And a critical early effort demonstrates why we cannot lose sight of the particular threat of police violence against black women. Almost a century ago, racialized police brutality in Washington, D.C., was surging. It included the shootings of 40 black men between the late 1920s and 1930s, as well as white officers subjecting at least 29 black women and girls, ranging in age from 15 to 68, to harassment, abuse and physical violence. No one was spared: not model citizens nor those who labored in the underground economy. Officers harassed teenage girls and mentally ill women. In several cases, the same officers who attacked black men barged into black women’s homes, policed them on the street, punched them in the face, knocked out their teeth and hurled racial epithets at them. To give one example, in 1936, sisters Martha and Ruth Lloyd, students at Dunbar High School, were exiting a bus at the corner of Tennessee Avenue and 14th Street NE. The sisters noticed that a riot was unfolding on the street and tried to escape the violence. But Officer John Sirola, dressed in plainclothes, grabbed Martha Lloyd and pinned her to the ground. Both sisters were arrested, and in the car, Sirola beat Martha Lloyd with his blackjack because she “sassed” him. This was not Sirola’s first use of force against a black citizen. Five years earlier, he and another officer had barged into the home of Henry Lincoln Johnson, a Pullman porter and veteran of World War I. They beat Johnson with a blackjack and broke his skull. While both officers were suspended from duty, Sirola was acquitted of any wrongdoing, and he went on to wield the same weapon on a 17-year-old black girl. The uptick in police brutality in the ’20s and ’30s can be traced to many factors. White police officers instinctively associated black women with criminality, arresting them at much higher rates than white women for disorderly conduct, intoxication, enticing prostitution and during Prohibition, bootlegging. The Great Depression plunged African Americans even deeper into poverty. Some black Washingtonians put food on the table by resorting to petty theft, while others staged militant mass marches. Both activities put white police officers on alert. This context created more face-to-face interactions between white officers and black women, and these encounters sometimes became violent. The economic crisis also threatened white men’s dominance, and some white police officers seemed to relish the opportunity to assert racial and sexual dominance over black women. Barging into a black woman’s home while she was asleep and alone, running a gun across her stomach and beating her was a display of power. Because of sexist assumptions, it was an exercise of power not only over black women themselves but over the men in their lives who could not protect them. These officers didn’t need to fear discipline because the city’s police chief, Maj. Ernest W. Brown, declined to punish officers for excessive use of force, and he was joined by the white judges who sat on the Police Court and the white officers who served on the Trial Boards. This power structure was entirely white — the police department employed 38 black policemen and only a single black policewoman — even though more than 70,000 black women resided in Washington, a byproduct of the lack of self-government for district residents. Black activists fought back, taking advantage of the national spotlight on Washington. The Washington chapter of the National Negro Congress called on citizens to “Make Washington Safe for Negro Womanhood.” Activists convinced Rep. Herman P. Kopplemann (D-Conn.) to issue a resolution to investigate police brutality in the House of Representatives and pressed the city’s Board of Commissioners to conduct an inquiry into the D.C. police. When these efforts failed to deliver results, activists held a protest parade in which they tried to carry empty coffins to symbolize the black victims, but officers forbade it. Instead, black and white marchers clutched signs emblazoned with the message, “Stop Legal Lynching” and chanted for Brown’s dismissal. In 1937, on D.C.’s radio station, WOL, activists read the names of victims of police violence, male and female. They even held their own police brutality trials to mete out justice when the local law looked askance. The national black press covered these campaigns, making citizens across the country aware of the crisis of police brutality in Washington. Yet only with the rape and killing of a white female clerk from Iowa did Congress call hearings on the city’s police department, faulting them for failing to solve the case. But scrutiny of Washington’s violence problem didn’t deliver justice. Instead, Rep. F. Edward Hérbert (D-La.), who sat on the Committee on the District of Columbia, openly endorsed police violence in the nation’s capital as a way to prevent black criminality. Ironically, the hearings convinced white Washingtonians that Brown was ineffective and he stepped down. Brown’s replacement, Edward J. Kelly, had been present at brutality marches, and once he took office, local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Negro Congress pushed him to use his power wisely. “Law abiding colored citizens must be made to know that policemen are the hired protectors of them,” the letter read, “and not their law protected lynchers.” Kelly listened. One month after he took office, he pledged reform at the Metropolitan Baptist Church, with 1,600 black Washingtonians in attendance. Kelly tripled the number of black police officers, including three black policewomen, and extended the hours of Police Court. The Municipal and Police courts merged, making Armond W. Scott the very first black judge to preside over Police Court. These reforms worked, and the number of cases of police brutality diminished dramatically. The rise in black officers created fewer face-to-face encounters between black women and white officers, while the addition of a black judge in Police Court enabled black Washingtonians to experience less bias in the justice system. In 1943, Kelly was invited to speak at a University of Chicago roundtable about white violence in policing, and the scholar E. Franklin Frazier, a critic of police brutality, praised Kelly’s record in Washington. But these improvements didn’t end gendered police brutality. Many white police officers continue to associate black women with criminality and over-police them. As of 2017, black women were twice as likely to serve time in prison as white women, according to the Sentencing Project. Time in prisons and jails poses a risk for black women: In 2015, a state trooper arrested Sandra Bland for failing to signal a lane change, and three days later, she was dead in her jail cell. And cases of police rape and sexual assault are an ongoing problem. Even today, the ACLU reports that in 35 states, police officers can use consent as a defense against sexual assault of arrestees while in custody. Yet one lesson of black Washingtonians in the 1930s is that change can come if activists call attention and politicize the over-policing and violence against black women, recognizing how gendered violence upholds white supremacy. Activism since Taylor’s killing captured the national spotlight, inspiring the Louisville police department to ban no-knock warrants, and probably contributing to the firing of one of the officers months after her death, but only weeks after it entered the spotlight. Communities can only be safe if they are safe for black women. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

police brutality,https://www.nytimes.com/article/portland-protests-explained-protesters.html,"What Do Portland Protesters Want, and How Have the Police Responded?","Eight weeks after the death of George Floyd, here’s a look at why longstanding protests in the city have recently intensified. When a video showing George Floyd’s death in police custody spread across social media, cities and towns nationwide soon erupted in protests against systemic racism and police brutality. But while protests in many places subsided after a few weeks, Portland, Ore., has been holding demonstrations every night since May 29.The arrival of federal forces in the city this month — and concerns they were exceeding their authority and violating protesters’ rights — drew the ire of local officials and reinvigorated nightly demonstrations. With renewed force, marchers have spray-painted the walls of the U.S. District Court building, demanding that federal agents go home. Groups of mothers have banded together, locking arms and chanting: “Feds stay clear. Moms are here.” Early in the protests, protesters broke into the Multnomah County Justice Center and set some of the offices on fire, and the Portland police have reported cases of looting. More recently, demonstrators have thrown rocks and bottles at federal officers. But many have protested peacefully, and Gov. Kate Brown has called the presence of federal agents an “abuse of power.” President Trump has called the demonstrators “anarchists” who “hate” the country, and Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, has blamed Oregon officials for the unrest. Federal officers in military gear … … clouds of tear gas … … crowd control munitions … [shots fired] … and locals who want those officers gone. “What are you guys protecting?” “Get the [expletive] out of our city!” In just over a week, the chaotic scenes in Portland grabbed the nation’s attention and raised questions about whether the U.S. government is exceeding its authority and violating civil rights. The officers came because of an executive order signed by President Trump in late June to protect federal property from destruction. “If we didn’t take a stand in Portland, you know, we’ve arrested many of these leaders. If we didn’t take that stand, right now you would have a problem like — they were going to lose Portland.” So what’s going on here? And what methods are the officers using to protect federal sites? Crowd: “Breonna Taylor!” The protests against racism and police brutality, which started in May, had largely been peaceful and were held across Portland. But after federal officers arrived in the city on July 4, demonstrations became centered around this U.S. District courthouse and this building housing federal agencies. Both are property of the U.S. government. The buildings have clearly been vandalized, and the Department of Homeland Security has a mandate to protect them. That’s usually done by officers from the Federal Protective Service. But on the ground in Portland, we have seen a new task force, including U.S. Marshals … … BORTAC, a unit of Customs and Border Protection … … and a special response team from ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. According to a government memo leaked to The Times, these units are insufficiently trained to perform crowd control. But that hasn’t stopped them from trying. Night after night, videos show these officers emerging from the two federal buildings as protesters draw near. Hundreds of videos reviewed by The Times show that although protesters were antagonistic, officers often responded with disproportionate force. [shouting] They blanketed streets with tear gas. “Are you OK?” They struck protesters with batons … … and used flash bangs, pepper balls and other less-lethal munitions to clear the streets. [chanting] Their actions often appeared to escalate rather than de-escalate matters. And in some instances, they attacked when there was no apparent threat. On July 11, protester Donavan La Bella was at the federal courthouse when an officer appears to have fired at his head in retaliation for tossing a spent tear gas canister. “[expletive] you!” [shot fired] La Bella’s mother told local media he suffered skull fractures and needed surgery. Later that night when field medics sought officers’ help for a wounded protester, they were aggressively cleared away. On July 18, a Navy veteran was batoned and pepper-sprayed in another unprovoked attack. His right hand was broken, and he needs surgery. Sometimes members of the press were hit. “He got shot in the back, obviously, and he’s wearing press —” This photographer, Mathieu Lewis Rolland, told The Times that a volley of 10 projectiles were fired into his back. “Ow, ow, ow!” In the middle of all this, protesters were detained in ways that alarmed civil rights advocates and former Homeland Security officials. “Can your people identify themselves as law enforcement?” On July 15, several federal officers were filmed driving in unmarked vehicles in the blocks around the courthouse. “How are we supposed to know who you are? How are we supposed to know you’re not kidnapping us and you’re civilians kidnapping us?” One protester was detained at this location nearby. “What are you doing?” Federal officers wouldn’t identify themselves … “Use your words!” … but patches on the right and left sides of their uniforms match those used by members of BORTAC, the tactical unit from Customs and Border Protection. They drove the protester away in an unmarked car. D.H.S. says federal officers have made 43 arrests since July 4. Agents do have the authority to make arrests if they believe that a federal crime has been committed, like damaging federal property or attacking officers. Crowd: “Hey, hey, ho, ho, these racist cops have got to go.” In recent days, the controversy mobilized a larger and more diverse crowd of protesters. [chanting] A so-called wall of moms led marches through Portland’s streets and to the federal courthouse where officers cleared them away. The federal presence has also inflamed tensions. Some demonstrators damaged paneling on the courthouse and tried to set them alight. Others threw water bottles and fired fireworks toward the building. On Wednesday, July 22, Portland’s mayor joined the protests and was caught in a cloud of tear gas. “This is a egregious overreaction on the part of the federal officers. This is not a de-escalation strategy. This is flat-out urban warfare.” At around the same time, a Customs and Border Protection plane was spotted circling overhead. C.B.P. officials told The Times it was sending a live video feed of the crowd to law enforcement on the ground. Crowd: “No justice, no peace! Protesters and local officials say this is all a case of federal overreach. Oregon’s attorney general has sued the federal government to stop arresting people. “Gas! Gas! Gas!” The president has doubled down, promising to send more federal officers to cities governed by his political rivals. “Because we’re not going to let New York and Chicago and Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore, and all of these — Oakland is a mess — we’re not going to let this happen in our country. All run by liberal Democrats.” The results could look like a national police force acting under presidential orders, able to ignore local demands and arrest residents. In Portland, it has been a recipe for chaos. [explosion] What started out as a movement for police accountability and racial justice has morphed into a complex mobilization. The protesters’ goals now include defunding the police, addressing income inequality and pushing federal agents out of the city. In Portland, which is one of America’s whitest cities and has a racist history, protesters have maintained a public call for change that has subsided elsewhere in the country. Experts say the protests bring together a coalition of racial justice proponents and anti-fascist advocates, who have long been active in Portland. The groups share some intersecting grievances and common goals, such as cutting police budgets and installing more civilian oversight of the police. Signs such as “White Silence=Violence” and “Black Lives Matter” are widespread, and calls at the demonstrations to address racial inequities persist. One woman held a sign that said: “My Black Child is Watching! #BLM She Will Know Her Life Matters.” Demonstrators have also expressed increasing frustration with the federal presence and the Trump administration. “What is making more people come to the street every night now is the brutalization that’s happening to regular community members at the hands of Portland police and these federal agents,” Jo Ann Hardesty, a city commissioner, said at a news conference. Street protests began four days after the death of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis. As the demonstrations continued and officers used tear gas to disperse crowds, public outrage against aggressive police tactics increased and calls to defund the police escalated. On June 8, after more than a week of large-scale demonstrations involving thousands of marchers, the chief of the Portland Police Bureau stepped down, saying new leadership was needed to rebuild public trust. Shortly after, a federal judge upheld restrictions on tear gas put in place by Mayor Ted Wheeler, barring the use of the chemical agent except when life or safety was at risk. The City Council also passed a budget that would cut $15 million from the police in the upcoming fiscal year, a demand sought by protesters. By late June, the size of protests had diminished significantly. Rose City Justice, a major mobilizing force in Portland, announced plans to pull back on organizing efforts. Nightly marches, numbering in the hundreds, became more decentralized. But after federal agents, including some from the Department of Homeland Security, arrived in July, reports soon emerged that they had forcefully pulled people into unmarked vehicles, injured protesters, and deployed tear gas. Mayor Wheeler, who called the situation “an attack on our democracy.” was tear-gassed with a group of protesters outside the federal courthouse. By the time the federal agents arrived, city leaders said, the situation on the streets had de-escalated. But outrage at the Trump administration’s deployment reinvigorated the daily rallies. The federal agents present in Portland include personnel from the U.S. Marshals and tactical agents from Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in addition to the Federal Protective Service, which was already stationed to protect federal property in Portland. Some of the agents are from a group known as BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s equivalent of a SWAT team, which typically investigates drug smuggling organizations. Oregon has a history of white supremacy. A law passed in 1844 said that any Black person would be “whipped twice a year until he or she shall quit the territory” and leaders also later banned Black people from entering the territory. Some protesters say the state’s deeply racist history is still reflected in Portland’s structures. One protester, Reginald Liggins, who is Black, told The New York Times that he began commuting by bus after being pulled over multiple times by the Portland police without reason. Liza Lopetrone, a veterinary nurse who is white and joined the Wall of Moms protest this week, said she wanted to bring the state’s white supremacist legacy to light. Others were not moved to participate until federal agents entered the city. Christopher J. David, a Navy veteran who was filmed being beaten with a baton by federal officers, had not followed the protests until U.S. agents were deployed. He came to the protests to ask officers about their use of violent tactics against protesters, which he said conflicted with their oath to uphold the Constitution."
